# Aspirational Audit — 2026-05-20

## Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total components | 1209 |
| REAL | 323 |
| DORMANT | 176 |
| ASPIRATIONAL | 69 |
| METADATA | 66 |
| DORMANT + ASPIRATIONAL ratio | 20.3% |

## Continuation status after follow-up implementation

This audit table is a point-in-time classification snapshot. The metrics above
remain useful for the 2026-05-20 audit baseline, but several high-ROI items
from the post-session backlog were closed after this report was generated.

| Area | Current status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| DX Tax 5 unchecked items | CLOSED 5/5 | `16de846f` lean baseline protections; `b33d8668` hygiene/blocker split; `a0bc577d` merge-queue default landing path; `b93fdd8f` merge-to-main lane evidence; `c4ab4905` default/core install distribution boundary. |
| Merge-queue lane recording | CLOSED | `scripts/merge-to-main.sh` persists `recommended_lane`, `executed_lane`, `validation_rationale`, and `changed_files`; covered by `tests/behavior/test_merge_to_main_lane_recording.py`. |
| Default-core install boundary | CLOSED | `manifests/primitive-install-boundary.yaml` is now the default/core projection contract; `scripts/cos_init.py` consumes it; `tests/behavior/test_install_core_boundary.py` asserts default-installed primitives are boundary-declared core. |
| Op Stability Phase 7 | CLOSED for the tracked exit criteria | Default/core projection is manifest-backed, `cos status --json` reports `profile` and `active_distribution`, and maintainer/lab tooling remains opt-in rather than default runtime. |
| Op Stability Phase 8 | CLOSED | Productization criteria are checked in `.cognitive-os/plans/architecture/operational-stability-friction-reduction.md`. |

Remaining work after this continuation is no longer the DX Tax/default-core
cluster. The next useful slices are governance policy adoption, telemetry
adoption/trending, and any explicitly chosen long-tail dormant/aspirational
cleanup.
