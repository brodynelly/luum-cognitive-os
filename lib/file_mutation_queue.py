"""
File Mutation Queue — Per-file serialization for concurrent writes.

Ensures that concurrent modifications to the same file are serialized,
while modifications to different files proceed in parallel.

Ported from: Pi coding-agent file-mutation-queue.ts (MIT license)
Adapted to Python using threading.Lock per resolved path.

Key differences from our advisory-only concurrent-write-guard.sh:
- ACTUALLY serializes writes (not just warns)
- Symlink-aware path resolution
- Self-cleaning when queue drains
- Thread-safe for multi-agent scenarios
