"""Capa 3 — Rules enforcement audit.

Classifies every rule in `rules/*.md` by its ACTUAL enforcement path and asserts
that the repository is self-consistent: rules claiming hook enforcement must have
the hook registered in `.claude/settings.json`; referenced files must exist; the
compact index must cover every non-excluded rule.

Read-only. Does not mutate any rule, hook, or settings file.

Marker: `@pytest.mark.audit` on every test so they can be run in isolation:
