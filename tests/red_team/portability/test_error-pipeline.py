"""Portability probes for hooks/error-pipeline.sh.

The hook is SCOPE: both — it must work for any consumer of this OS, not
only the one consumer whose service names historically leaked into the
hook source. These probes falsify the post-Tier-1 invariant that no
consumer-specific identifiers remain in the executable hook code.
