# Frozen Backlog — Pre-Stabilization Plans

Consolidated inventory of all plans, decisions, and queued work from engram that was frozen during the stabilization freeze (ADR-017) and the April 2026 stabilization sessions.

**Purpose:** Single source of truth for "what to work on when the OS is stable enough." These items were deferred because the user chose stabilization over new features — resume them when the stabilization roadmap is complete.

**Status reference (2026-04-16):** OS is ~93-95% stable. Do NOT start items from this backlog until stabilization hits 100%.

## P0 — Cross-Device Memory Sync ✅ DONE (April 16)

**Status:** Activated during session 2026-04-16. 544 project-scoped observations now cross-device via git.

**What was done:**
- `scripts/engram-sync.sh` created — filters by project (luum-cognitive-os/luum-agent-os/cognitive-os-demo)
- Hooks activated in settings.json: Stop (sync) + SessionStart (import)
- First export committed: `.engram/exports/luum-cognitive-os.jsonl` (1.5MB, 544 observations)
- Pre-commit gate exempts `.engram/exports/` from project-term blocker (historical content in observations)

**How it works now:**
1. Session end → `engram-auto-sync.sh` exports via `scripts/engram-sync.sh` + commits to git
2. Next session on any device → `engram-auto-import.sh` reads JSONL, imports into local engram
3. Only project-scoped observations sync — your other engram memories stay local

**Scope:** 544 of 2,348 total observations (23%). Other projects' memory not exported.

---

### (Original plan — preserved for reference)

**Solution: Activate existing `packages/engram-sync` package**

Agentic primitives that already exist (Apache-2.0):
- `hooks/engram-auto-sync.sh` — Stop event, exports observations to `.engram/exports/*.json`
- `hooks/engram-auto-import.sh` — SessionStart event, imports JSONs into local engram
- `hooks/memu-sync.sh` — memU bridge (optional)

**Activation steps (1 hour):**
1. Register both hooks in `.claude/settings.json` (Stop + SessionStart, async)
2. Create `.engram/exports/` directory and add to git
3. Test round-trip: export on device A → commit → pull on device B → import → verify engram has same data
4. Document pattern in `docs/setup/cross-device-memory.md`

**Alternatives evaluated:**
- Engram cloud (Postgres): real-time but requires server — deferred
- Litestream → S3: WAL replica — deferred, read-only
- Git-LFS for engram.db: simple but 20MB per commit — rejected
- Turso/LibSQL embedded: multi-master — deferred, curve

**Rationale:** engram-sync is Apache-2.0, already installed, git-based (no new infra), legible JSON format (diffable). Simplest path to device portability.

## P1 — Core vs Extensions Audit (MVP DONE 2026-04-20 — waves pending)

**Status (2026-04-20):** MVP delivered — audit complete, migration plan approved, first extension (`cos-advisory-llm`) extracted as proof-of-concept with backwards-compat symlinks. 14 packs and shim cleanup remain (21 waves → v1.0).

- Audit: `docs/architecture/core-vs-extensions-audit-2026-04-20.md` (581 agentic primitives classified: 126 CORE, 453 EXTENSION, 2 REMOVE).
- Plan: `.cognitive-os/plans/architecture/core-vs-extensions-migration-plan.md` (21 waves, one pack per minor version).
- POC: `packages/cos-advisory-llm/` (3 LLM hooks moved, symlinks at `hooks/*-llm.sh`, both profiles smoke-tested green).
- Debt row D43 → PARTIAL.

**Why:** 141 commits between v0.8.7 and v0.9.0 added many agentic primitives directly to root. Some are core (vendor-agnostic, always-loaded) but others are extensions that should live in `packages/` for optional installation.

### Candidates to move to `packages/`

**→ `packages/advisory-llm/` (NEW):**
- `hooks/prompt-quality-llm.sh` (Haiku-evaluated prompt quality)
- `hooks/completeness-check-llm.sh` (Haiku-evaluated completeness)
- `hooks/confidence-gate-llm.sh` (Haiku Trust Report verification)

Reason: requires Anthropic Haiku API access. Users without API access can't run these. Belongs as an optional extension.

**→ `packages/claude-code-integration/` (NEW):**
- `hooks/recap-sync.sh` + `hooks/_lib/recap_adapter.py` (integrates with Claude Code `/recap`)

Reason: Claude Code-specific. Other AI coding agents (Codex, Gemini, Cursor, Windsurf) don't have `/recap`. Belongs as provider-specific extension.

### Deprecate / remove (superseded)

- `hooks/task-panel-sync.sh` → superseded by `hooks/task-bridge-notify.sh` (ADR-024)
- `hooks/_lib/task_panel_adapter.py` → folded into `hooks/_lib/task_bridge.py`

### Keep as core (verified vendor-agnostic)

- `cmd/cos-dispatch/` + `internal/*` + `pkg/*` — the Go dispatcher (core engine)
- `lib/pattern_detector.py`, `lib/adr_detector.py` — self-awareness mechanisms
- `hooks/_lib/task_bridge.py` + `hooks/task-bridge-notify.sh` — correlation pattern works for any tool
- `hooks/_lib/file_checker.sh` — symlink safety, universal
- `hooks/_lib/session_init_helper.py` — generic session lifecycle
- `hooks/_lib/singularity-suggestion.sh` — project-agnostic advisory
- `scripts/*` (setup, doctor, engram-sync, check-test-quality, generate-compact-catalog)
- `templates/agent-mandatory-rules.md` — applies to any sub-agent
- 22 ADRs + 4 living docs

### Task size

~4 hours: create 2 new packages, move 5 files, update `settings.json` + profile scripts, verify nothing breaks. Should happen BEFORE v1.0 to avoid shipping a bloated core.

## HOW TO USE THIS BACKLOG

1. **DO NOT** start items while stabilization is in progress (see `stabilization-roadmap.md`)
2. **DO** check engram for full context before resuming an item (`mem_search` with the engram ID or topic_key)
3. **DO** update this file when items complete — move to "Archive" section (to be added)
4. **DO** file new deferred work here (not scattered in engram)

## Next review

## Harness Adoption Gap — RESOLVED (2026-04-16)

**Status:** ✅ Root cause fixed in same session it was discovered. No longer a frozen item.

**Moved to:** [`docs/architecture/harness-adoption-gap/ADR-001-harness-skills-sync-path.md`](harness-adoption-gap/ADR-001-harness-skills-sync-path.md)

**Summary of resolution** (full detail in ADR-001 + `diagnosis.md`):
- Root cause: `hooks/self-install.sh` synced `skills/` → `.cognitive-os/skills/` (wrong destination). Claude Code harness reads `{project}/.claude/skills/`.
- Fix: single-line addition to `SYNC_DIRS` in `self-install.sh` (the `resolve_dest` case for `claude` already existed).
- Empirical verification: Experiment 1 (throwaway skill under `.claude/skills/`) confirmed harness read path on 2026-04-16.
- Post-fix count: 126/126 skills exposed (was 40/126).

**Remaining follow-ups** (legitimately frozen for v1.0+):
- **P1 — Forcing function**: `PreToolUse` hook on `Agent` that detects inline canon and suggests `/compose-prompt` — deferred because current auto-injection of `agent-preamble.md` already covers 80% of the need.
- **P2 — Minimal profile**: `cognitive-os-init --profile=<docs|backend|security|full>` to curate initial skill set. Deferred as UX refinement.

**Meta-lesson (worth preserving)**: Self-dogfooding revealed the gap. The orchestrator of this very project was inline-pegating agent canon because the core skills weren't reachable. The diagnostic agent found the root cause in ~20 minutes; the fix was 1 line. The OS is not broken — the install-to-harness path was.
