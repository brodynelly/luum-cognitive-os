# ADR-276: Primitive Authority and Write-Effects Audit

## Status

Accepted and implemented for the first ratchet.

## Context

Cognitive OS already separates several concepts:

- `SCOPE` says whether a primitive is intended for the SO, a consumer project, or both.
- Consumer availability says whether a primitive is projected or only local evidence.
- Projection profiles say which files are copied, linked, or generated into consumer workspaces.
- Protected config write guards block direct agent writes to control-plane paths.
- Consumer improvement proposal imports are `runtime_effect: none`.
- `.ai` consumer smokes prove selected generated overlays do not mutate real consumers.

These controls were necessary but not sufficient. They answered visibility and
selected write paths, but not the higher-level question:

> When a script or shared primitive runs, which roots may it read and write, and
> how do we detect obvious writes outside that authority?

Without a first-class authority layer, agents could confuse “projected” with
“allowed to mutate”, or “SO-local” with “safe to run inside a consumer project”.

## Decision

Introduce `manifests/primitive-authority.yaml` as the canonical authority
contract for primitive/script write effects.

The contract defines these modes:

- `observe-only`
- `propose-only`
- `project-local-write`
- `os-maintainer-write`
- `profile-projection-write`
- `dangerous-human-approved`

Authority can be explicit per path or derived from existing sources:

- `manifests/primitive-scope-classification.yaml`
- `manifests/primitive-consumer-availability.yaml`
- `manifests/primitive-projection-profiles.yaml`
- `manifests/shell-ci-projection.yaml`
- generated primitive readiness ledgers
- `manifests/protected-config-write-policy.yaml`

Add `scripts/primitive_authority_audit.py` and wrapper
`scripts/cos-primitive-authority-audit` to produce JSON and Markdown reports at:

- `docs/reports/primitive-authority-latest.json`
- `docs/reports/primitive-authority-latest.md`

The audit has two layers:

1. Static detection of obvious write APIs and shell write operations.
2. Dynamic filesystem-delta smokes for the initial high-risk/safe-to-run slice:
   consumer improvement export/import, Shell/CI projection, and `cos_init` Codex
   projection.

ACC consumes this report as `authority_write_effects` so primitive capability
coverage includes write-boundary evidence.

## Blocking contradictions

The first ratchet blocks only high-confidence contradictions:

- `propose-only` writing live hooks/rules/skills/scripts/templates/manifests or
  consumer source/secrets;
- `observe-only` writing live runtime/control-plane surfaces;
- project/shared primitives deriving `os-maintainer-write` by accident;
- profile projection attempting to write secrets.

The audit intentionally does not claim perfect behavior for every argument of
every script. It establishes a durable contract, catches obvious write-surface
contradictions, and creates a ratchet for expanding dynamic proof.

## Consequences

Positive:

- Scope, projection, and write authority are no longer conflated.
- Propose-only and profile-projection paths now have machine-readable guardrails.
- ACC can surface authority drift as coverage debt.
- Future dynamic write-effect smokes have a stable manifest and report shape.

Tradeoffs:

- Static detection is conservative and can miss computed paths.
- Some legitimate scripts are only classified by derived defaults until explicit
  entries are added.
- Exhaustive argument-space proof remains out of scope for this first ratchet.

## Validation

```bash
python3 scripts/primitive_authority_audit.py --project-dir . --json --fail-on-block
python3 -m pytest \
  tests/contracts/test_primitive_authority_contract.py \
  tests/contracts/test_primitive_authority_static_audit.py \
  tests/contracts/test_primitive_authority_dynamic_smoke.py \
  tests/unit/test_primitive_authority_audit.py \
  tests/unit/test_acc_authority_adapter.py -q
```
