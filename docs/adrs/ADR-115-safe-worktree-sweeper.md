# ADR-115: Safe Worktree Sweeper

## Status

Accepted — 2026-05-02. Scope: OS core. Related: ADR-109, ADR-111, ADR-113.

## Context

Cognitive OS creates temporary and validation worktrees for laptop tests, validation capsules, and recovery workflows. These worktrees are useful while active, but stale detached worktrees can accumulate and confuse operators.

Manual cleanup with recursive deletion is unsafe. A worktree can look stale while still being used by `make`, `cos-test`, `pytest`, hooks, or daemons. Raw deletion can also leave git worktree metadata stale.

## Decision

Introduce a safe sweeper primitive:

- implementation and Python CLI: `scripts/cos_worktree_sweeper.py`
- optional human shell wrapper: `scripts/cos-worktree-sweeper.sh`

The implementation uses underscore naming so it is importable, testable, and compliant with the repository Python script naming contract. The hyphenated path is Bash only, preserving operator-friendly shell ergonomics without creating hyphenated Python files.

## Safety invariants

1. Dry-run is the default.
2. `--apply` is required for deletion.
3. The primary repository worktree is never removed.
4. Branch worktrees are never removed by default.
5. Worktrees outside safe prefixes are kept.
6. Worktrees with live processes or open files are kept.
7. Worktrees with tracked modifications are kept.
8. Worktrees with non-allowlisted untracked files are kept.
9. TTL must elapse before a detached worktree can be removed.
10. Removal uses `git worktree remove --force`, never raw recursive deletion.

## Consequences

The SO can automate cleanup of stale laptop worktrees while preserving active validation capsules and hidden work. This also establishes the naming pattern for CLIs: Python implementations and direct Python CLIs use underscore filenames; human-facing hyphenated entrypoints are Bash wrappers.


## Alternatives rejected

| Alternative | Why rejected |
|---|---|
| Delete stale worktrees with `rm -rf` | Unsafe because git worktree metadata and live processes can be left inconsistent. |
| Sweep all detached worktrees without TTL | Active validation capsules and recent recovery worktrees can look detached while still useful. |
| Provide a hyphenated Python wrapper | Violates the repository snake_case Python script contract and duplicates the importable CLI. Use a Bash wrapper when a hyphenated operator command is needed. |


## Verification

```bash
python3 scripts/cos_worktree_sweeper.py --dry-run --json
bash scripts/cos-worktree-sweeper.sh --dry-run --json
python3 -m pytest tests/behavior/test_cos_worktree_sweeper.py -q
```
