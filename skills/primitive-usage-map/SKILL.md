# Primitive Usage Map

## Purpose

Use this skill to answer questions such as:

- Which skills use each Python script?
- Which scripts are referenced only by tests or docs?
- Which primitives have no visible static consumer?
- Where should a missing skill, hook, rule, or workflow be added before a reducer archives anything?

The backing script is `scripts/primitive_usage_map.py`. It is static reachability,
not runtime execution coverage.

## Commands

Map Python scripts:

```bash
python3 scripts/primitive_usage_map.py --target-family scripts
```

Map other primitive families:

```bash
python3 scripts/primitive_usage_map.py --target-family hooks
python3 scripts/primitive_usage_map.py --target-family skills
python3 scripts/primitive_usage_map.py --target-family rules
```

Write custom report files:

```bash
python3 scripts/primitive_usage_map.py \
  --target-family scripts \
  --json-out docs/06-Daily/reports/primitive-usage-map-scripts.json \
  --md-out docs/06-Daily/reports/primitive-usage-map-scripts.md
```

## Interpretation

- `without_skill_consumer` means no `SKILL.md` mentions the target.
- `without_any_consumer` means no scanned skill, hook, rule, test, doc, workflow,
  config, or script mentions the target.
- A static consumer is not proof of runtime use. Pair this report with hook timing,
  row audit, claim proof audit, and behavior tests.

## Contextual Trigger

Use when the user says: qué skills usan scripts, primitive usage, coverage de primitivas, scripts sin skill, mapa de dependencias entre primitivas.
