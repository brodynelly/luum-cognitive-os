# Shell / CI portable `.ai` adapter

Schema: `portable-ai-adapter.v1`

This adapter is generated from Cognitive OS canonical primitive manifests.
It must not invent primitive behavior or overclaim runtime enforcement.

## Current projection

- harness id: `shell-ci`
- status: `implemented`
- proof level: `structural`
- projection mode: `cli-and-workflows`

## Settings paths

- `.cognitive-os/shell-ci-projection.json`
- `.github/workflows/cognitive-os-shell-ci.yml`
- `scripts`

## Rule

Read `.ai/profiles/shell-ci.json` for declared fidelity before projecting primitives into this host.
Structural advisory surfaces are not runtime enforcement.
