# ADR Tombstone

This is an **agentic primitive**: the reusable procedure and deterministic tooling for tombstoning ADR records. The ADR files it creates are documentation records, not the primitive itself.

Use this skill when an ADR number must remain reserved but the original decision
text should no longer live in active first-party documentation.

## Boundary

- Primitive: `skills/adr-tombstone/`, `scripts/adr_tombstone.py`, `scripts/cos-adr-tombstone`, and their tests.
- ADR record: `docs/02-Decisions/adrs/ADR-NNN-tombstone.md`, generated or repaired by the primitive.
- Do not confuse the existence of a tombstone ADR with the primitive that manages tombstones.

## Rules

- Never reuse an ADR number for a different decision.
- Prefer a neutral file name: `docs/02-Decisions/adrs/ADR-NNN-tombstone.md`.
- The first heading must match the filename number.
- The tombstone must include the same required ADR sections as normal ADRs.
- Do not include removed integration names or other purged terms in tombstone text.
- Update links from the removed ADR filename to the neutral tombstone filename.
- Validate the full ADR sequence after creating or repairing tombstones.

## Workflow

1. Identify the ADR number and any forbidden terms that must not reappear.
2. Run the deterministic helper:

```bash
scripts/cos-adr-tombstone \
  --number NNN \
  --title "Removed architecture decision" \
  --reason "The original decision content was removed from the active architecture surface." \
  --forbidden-token "term-to-keep-out" \
  --validate-forbidden-tokens
```

3. If only filling a numbering gap, omit `--forbidden-token` and use a reason like:

```text
This ADR number is intentionally reserved so the ADR sequence remains contiguous.
```

4. Validate:

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/unit/test_adr_tombstone.py tests/contracts/test_adr_numbering_integrity.py -q
```

5. If the task is a full purge, also run the repository-specific no-reference
   contract for the removed surface.

## Output expectations

Report the tombstone path, removed ADR files, updated references, and validation
commands. Do not commit or push unless explicitly asked.
