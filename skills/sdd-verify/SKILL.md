# SDD Verify

## Purpose

Independently verify implementation against SDD requirements and EAS executable evidence.

## EAS Verification Rule

When EAS exists, verification must run. If the user or project policy requested EARS, include `--require-ears`:

```bash
python3 scripts/eas_validate.py <eas.md>
python3 scripts/eas_validate.py --require-ears <eas.md>
```

Verification fails if the validator fails, unless the user explicitly accepts a partial EAS and the verify report records each residual risk.

## Procedure

1. Read apply-progress and EAS.
2. Apply `rules/adversarial-review.md`: produce at least one finding and classify severity.
3. Run `python3 scripts/eas_validate.py <eas.md>` when EAS exists; use `--require-ears` when EARS syntax is required by the user or project policy.
4. Execute verification commands listed in EAS or mark manual checks with evidence.
5. Confirm every `REQ-*` is covered by `AC-*` and evidence.
6. Confirm at least one detractor mode is named when EAS exists: Tenth Man Rule, Devil's Advocate, Pre-mortem, Black Hat, or Red Team.
7. Confirm every `OBJ-*` detractor objection is resolved, converted into a task, or carried as residual risk.
8. Confirm residual risks are explicit, bounded, and acceptable for the current project phase.
9. Return PASS only when validation and verification evidence support it.
