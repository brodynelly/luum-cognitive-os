> - install-timing: **unmeasured**

## Phase 1 — Aggressive Prune (week 1)

Target end-date: 2026-05-08. Exit metric: `dormant_aspirational_ratio < 0.25` AND `zero ASPIRATIONAL`.

### Day 0 (2026-04-24) — Triage

- [x] Run `uv run python3 scripts/aspirational-audit.py --json > .cognitive-os/reports/prune-baseline.json` — Done 2026-04-30: baseline captured (total=656, dormant_aspirational_ratio=0.3521)
- [x] Generate punch list per bucket: — Done 2026-05-01: 4 markdown files created from aspirational-audit-2026-05-01.md (today's audit: 667 total, 69 ASPIRATIONAL, ratio=0.3538)
  - [x] DORMANT >180d sin test/marker: `grep-mtime + classification == DORMANT` — captured in punch-list-lib.md (1 item: lib/jupyter_client.py) and punch-list-hooks.md (DORMANT worst offenders)
  - [x] ASPIRATIONAL: all 71 entries from audit — 59 hooks in punch-list-hooks.md, 10 skills in punch-list-skills.md, 0 lib, 0 rules
- [x] Issue `.cognitive-os/reports/prune-triage-2026-04-24.md` — 1 row per item with proposed action {REMOVE / PROVE / IMPLEMENT / REFERENCE-OK} — Done 2026-04-24: 250 items, 4 buckets. Superseded by `docs/reports/prune-triage-2026-05-01.md` (2026-05-01) which refined ASPIRATIONAL items into DELETE/IMPLEMENT/DEFER.

### Days 1-7 — "Remove or prove" window

- [x] For each ASPIRATIONAL DELETE item: archive via `git mv` to `docs/archive/hooks/` — Done 2026-05-01: 3 hooks archived (completeness-check.sh, post-agent-verify.sh, prompt-quality.sh). `docs/archive/hooks/` created.
- [x] For each ASPIRATIONAL DEFER item with conditional trigger: add `@on-demand` or `@manual-trigger` marker — Done 2026-05-01: all 8 Batch-4 hooks already carry markers (global-verify.sh, orchestrator-mode-detect.sh, package-sync.sh, semgrep-scan.sh, worktree-submodule-fix.sh, pre-cleanup-snapshot.sh, guardrails-validator.sh, idle-service-cleanup.sh).
- [ ] For each DORMANT item: author a test that would promote to ON_DEMAND/REAL, OR remove reference. (ONGOING — 135 KEEP+TEST items from prune-triage-2026-04-24.md; large batch, tracked separately in punch-lists)
- [ ] Daily snapshot: `scripts/aspirational-audit.py --persist` to `.cognitive-os/metrics/aspirational-audit.jsonl`.

### Day 14 — Auto-archive cutoff

- [x] ASPIRATIONAL items archived or marked: 3 deleted, 8 marked @on-demand/@manual-trigger per prune-triage-2026-05-01.md Batch 1+4. Remaining 54 DEFER items documented with Phase 2/3 assignment — no git mv needed (not dead code, deferred with rationale).
- [ ] Re-run audit. Goal: ratio <0.25.
- [ ] Commit archival batch once DORMANT test/marker work reduces ratio sufficiently.

### Exit criteria (Phase 1)

- [ ] `dormant_aspirational_ratio < 0.25` (hard).
- [ ] ASPIRATIONAL count == 0 (hard — either resolved or removed).
- [ ] `docs/archive/` receives items (history preserved, no deletion).
- [ ] dogfood-score `skill_coverage` or `hook_wiring` improves ≥10 points (soft).

## Phase 2 — Install Timing Measurement (week 2)

Target end-date: 2026-05-15. Exit metric: honest number on file.

### Day 8 — Tooling

- [x] Create `scripts/install-timing-test.sh` (schema in ADR-059 §Phase 2). — Done 2026-04-30: script created with ADR-059 schema; clones repo into tmp, times setup.sh, emits JSONL record
- [x] Add Makefile target: `make install-test`. — Done 2026-04-30: target added, supports PROFILE= override
- [x] Emit JSONL records to `.cognitive-os/metrics/install-timing.jsonl`. — Done 2026-04-30: lib/install_timing.py provides append_install_record(); script uses it directly via embedded python3
- [x] Make `scripts/setup.sh` fully headless (no interactive prompts) — Phase 2 prerequisite. — Done 2026-04-30: added NONINTERACTIVE=1 to Homebrew install invocation; colors already suppressed when not a tty

### Days 9-10 — Baseline runs

- [x] Run `make install-test` 5× on fresh tmpdirs. Record mean + p95. — Done 2026-05-01: 5 runs via file:// clone; mean=38.8s, p95=43s, all PASS (budget=300s); bug in count_errors() fixed (grep -c || echo 0 double-print)
- [x] Document errors + manual steps (if any) in `.cognitive-os/reports/install-timing-baseline-2026-05-XX.md`. — Done 2026-05-01: docs/reports/install-timing-baseline-2026-05-01.md written

### Day 11 — Verdict

- [ ] If `elapsed_s < 300` AND `manual_steps <= 3` AND `errors == 0`: keep "plug-and-play" claim in README.
- [ ] Else: demote claim in README to "scripted install (N min, M manual steps)" with honest numbers.
- [ ] Commit README change.

### Exit criteria (Phase 2)

- [ ] `install-timing.jsonl` has ≥5 records.
- [ ] README.md either keeps or demotes PnP claim based on data.
- [x] `tests/contracts/test_install_timing.py` (NEW) asserts future runs stay within budget (regression guard). — Done 2026-04-30: 12 contract tests + 5 unit tests in tests/unit/test_install_timing.py; all pass

## Phase 3 — Core vs Extensions Split (week 3)

Target end-date: 2026-05-15. Exit metric: default install <3 min, extensions opt-in works.

> **Design note (2026-05-02):** Classification criteria and extension pack taxonomy are fully documented in `docs/architecture/core-vs-extensions-audit-2026-04-20.md` (126 CORE primitives of 581 total = 22% core / 78% extensions) and the migration plan at `.cognitive-os/plans/architecture/core-vs-extensions-migration-plan.md`. Phase 3 implements that design. Refer to those docs for the authoritative 1:1 mapping. Do NOT re-derive classification from scratch — use existing audit.

### Classification Criteria (established 2026-04-20, reaffirmed 2026-05-02)

A primitive is **CORE** if ALL of:
1. Called by 3+ CORE hooks OR underpins `cos init` / session-start sequence
2. No external service dependency (no Docker, Valkey, MLflow, Langfuse, Aguara, Parry, NeMo, etc.)
3. Required for the scale-adaptive bypass rule + trivial task path to work
4. No vendor-specific integration (Claude Code harness specifics → EXTENSION)

A primitive is **EXTENSION** if ANY of:
- Requires an external service / API credential not universally present
- Serves a specific methodology (SDD → cos-sdd), team size (agent-coordination), or compliance profile
- Is a per-tool integration (semgrep, parry, aguara, e2b, tero, etc.)
- Was classified ASPIRATIONAL or DORMANT in Phase 1 triage (no observable production use)

Counts per surface: Hooks 38 CORE / 97 EXTENSION (target <40 CORE ✓), Libs 24/126, Rules 28/75, Skills 20/107, Scripts 16/48.

### Day 15 — Reclassification

- [ ] Verify current counts against audit (re-run aspirational_audit to confirm items haven't shifted classification since 2026-04-20 audit)
- [ ] Output: `.cognitive-os/reports/core-extension-split-2026-05-XX.md` — delta from 2026-04-20 audit (new items, reclassified items, removed items)
- [ ] Sub-task: confirm 15 extension packs from audit still map correctly to `packages/cos-{name}/` targets

### Days 16-18 — File migration (wave approach per migration plan)

- [ ] Wave 0 (prerequisite): verify `packages/cos-{name}/cos-package.yaml` schema supports `hook_registrations:` key
- [ ] Wave 1 (highest blast-radius items): migrate `cos-advisory-llm` pack (`*-llm.sh` hooks + advisor_*.py libs)
  - [ ] `git mv hooks/*-llm.sh packages/cos-advisory-llm/hooks/`
  - [ ] Leave backward-compat symlink at old path for one release cycle
  - [ ] Update `scripts/apply-efficiency-profile.sh` to read from pack manifest
- [ ] Wave 2: migrate `cos-sdd` pack (sdd-* skills + sdd_*.py libs)
- [ ] Wave 3: migrate `cos-observability` (mlflow, langfuse, paperclip hooks + libs)
- [ ] Remaining waves: defer to post-v1.0 if time constrained — document what was done vs deferred
- [ ] Update `skills/CATALOG-COMPACT.md` generator to list core separately from extensions (add `[core]` / `[ext:pack-name]` tags)

### Day 19 — On-demand install

- [ ] Create `/install-skill <name>` skill:
  - [ ] Looks up `<name>` in `skills/extensions/` (or `packages/cos-*/skills/`)
  - [ ] If exists: symlinks into skills routing + registers in `cognitive-os.yaml extensions:` key
  - [ ] If not found: errors with list of available extensions from CATALOG-COMPACT
  - [ ] Acceptance: `/install-skill dogfood-score` succeeds end-to-end in a test
- [ ] Same for `/install-hook <name>` (looks up in extension packs, adds to settings.json)

### Day 20 — Validation

- [ ] Run `make install-test --profile core` → must be <3 min
- [ ] Run `/install-skill <random-extension>` → must succeed
- [ ] Run `tests/contracts/test_core_extensions_split.py` — all pass (NEW file; must be created)
- [ ] Final dogfood-score: expect ≥75/100 (from 65.66) driven by skill_coverage + hook_wiring improvement

### Exit criteria (Phase 3)

- [ ] Default install `<3 min`, 0 manual steps, 0 errors.
- [ ] `tests/contracts/test_core_extensions_split.py` passes.
- [ ] `/install-skill` + `/install-hook` work on-demand.
- [ ] dogfood-score ≥75/100.
- [ ] README rewritten to explain core-vs-extensions concept.
