"""Targeted test resolver — ADR-027 Phase 1.

Given a list of changed files (from `git diff --name-only`), returns the set
of test file paths likely to exercise the changed code. Used by
`hooks/global-verify.sh` to run a focused baseline + after suite instead of
the full 9,000-test collection.

Resolution strategy (naming conventions in this repo):

    lib/foo.py                     → tests/unit/test_foo.py
                                     tests/behavior/test_foo.py
    packages/pkg/lib/foo.py        → tests/unit/test_foo.py
                                     tests/behavior/test_foo.py
    hooks/foo.sh                   → tests/hooks/test_foo.py
                                     tests/behavior/test_foo.py
    packages/pkg/hooks/foo.sh      → tests/hooks/test_foo.py
    scripts/foo.sh                 → tests/integration/test_foo.py
    tests/**/test_*.py             → itself
    docs/**, rules/**, *.md        → skipped (no tests)

If a candidate test file does not exist, it is dropped. If zero tests resolve,
the caller should fall back to a broader suite or skip verification.

Public API:
    resolve_tests_for_changes(changed_files: List[str]) -> List[str]
        Returns existing test file paths as strings relative to the project root.

Python 3.9+ compatible, stdlib only.
