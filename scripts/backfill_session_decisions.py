"""backfill_session_decisions.py — One-shot script to persist already-answered decisions.

These decisions exist in research reports and have recommended answers inline,
but were never persisted as engram observations (the ADR-069 §5b OR-ambiguity bug).
Running this script marks them ANSWERED in engram so /decision-triage stops surfacing
them as false-critical decisions.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/backfill_session_decisions.py [--dry-run]

ADR-069 §5b fix: This backfill captures the decisions that were accepted during the
2026-04-24/25 sessions when the OR ambiguity meant nobody called record_decision().
