# Primitive Harvester

Use this skill when a conversation starts producing a repeatable workflow,
operator checklist, scriptable safety sequence, or reusable governance pattern.
The harvester is advisory: it classifies and plans, but it does not mutate the
repo by itself.

## Decision classes

- `CREATE_PRIMITIVE`: create a new skill/script/hook/docs/tests bundle.
- `IMPROVE_EXISTING`: extend an existing primitive instead of duplicating it.
- `USE_EXISTING`: invoke the existing primitive; do not create a new artifact.
- `DOCUMENT_ONLY`: preserve the decision/tradeoff as ADR/docs, no executable.
- `DISCARD`: keep as ordinary conversation or Engram learning.

## Run

```bash
python3 scripts/cos_primitive_harvester.py \
  --repo "$PWD" \
  --conversation-file /path/to/conversation.txt \
  --json
```

For a short excerpt:

```bash
python3 scripts/cos_primitive_harvester.py --repo "$PWD" --text "..." --json
```

## Promotion rule

Promote only when the workflow is:

```text
repeatable + risky/valuable + verifiable + portable
```

If the repo already has a matching primitive, improve or use that primitive
instead of creating a duplicate.

## Required follow-up for CREATE/IMPROVE

1. Write or update the listed artifacts.
2. Add behavior tests and red-team/portability tests.
3. Validate with the emitted validation plan.
4. Land through the governed merge queue.
5. Save the decision/discovery to Engram.
