## What this session closed

Commits since 2026-05-19 (HEAD: `50ffba60`):

| Commit | Subject | Class |
|---|---|---|
| `50ffba60` | Slice A residual — 10 candidate transitions | lifecycle |
| `0c2f18ba` | ADR-038 Wave 3 — Pydantic TrustReport schema + parser | structural |
| `2930a125` | post-Bash drain tick surfaces ready queued agents | dispatch-fix |
| `6e4f8f71` | eliminate expected-failure debt | audit |
| `a851c8dc` | refresh AI-overlay lifecycle metadata | lifecycle |
| `3ce016d2` | repair Bash JSON-default corruption + wire MAX_PARALLEL env | dispatch-fix |
| `40762666` | collapse ghost validation-capsule detection paths | dispatch-fix |
| `16eba828` | reject empty Agent prompts at enqueue + drain | dispatch-fix |
| `d5805294` | apply Batch A+B+E lifecycle promotions — 43 items | lifecycle |
| `e3029d5d` | mark 9 verified op-stability acceptance items | docs |

Plus earlier in the arc (pre-2026-05-19): telemetry Phase 2 rollups,
ADR-038 Wave 2 input schema validator, hook maturity Phase 2 closure,
session report + parallel backlog.

**Dogfooding wins:** four of the ten commits above
(`16eba828`, `40762666`, `3ce016d2`, `2930a125`) closed structural bugs
in the dispatch/queue/validation primitives themselves — the SO caught
its own gaps. Postmortem at
`docs/06-Daily/reports/dispatch-gate-empty-prompt-ghost-lock-postmortem-2026-05-20.md`.

## Outstanding work, ranked by ROI

| # | Item | Effort | Why it matters | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | DX Tax 5 items left unchecked in op-stability plan | 2-4h each (=10-20h) | Real implementation: lean-profile semantics, hygiene-vs-blocker, merge-queue lane recording, default-core install boundary, merge-queue default path. Closes Phase 6/7 of `operational-stability-friction-reduction.md`. | `.cognitive-os/plans/architecture/operational-stability-friction-reduction.md` |
| 2 | ADR-038 Wave 4 — hook wiring + grading policy | 1 slice | Wave 3 (`0c2f18ba`) shipped schema+parser. Wave 4 enforces the trust-report contract at agent stop. **Open question:** reject legacy reports or keep `max(count, 1)` fallback? | `docs/02-Decisions/adrs/ADR-038-*` |
| 3 | Maintainer Telemetry Phase 5 — impact measurement | 1 slice | Phase 2 emits skill/provider/primitive rollups. Phase 5 measures whether rollups change operator decisions. | engram topic `maintainer-telemetry-phases` |
| 4 | Op Stability Phase 3 — adaptive profiles resolver | multi-sesión | `lean|standard|strict` profile picker per phase + per surface. | op-stability plan §Phase 3 |
| 5 | Op Stability Phase 7 — distribution boundary metadata | multi-sesión | Every projected primitive has distribution metadata; maintainer/lab off default runtime path. | op-stability plan §Phase 7 |
| 6 | Op Stability Phase 8 — productization threshold | multi-sesión | 6 exit-criteria checkboxes (status accuracy, false-positive trend, merge-queue default, chaos N=10/20/50, etc.). Mostly verified this session — outstanding: hygiene-vs-blocker, merge-queue default path. | op-stability plan §Phase 8 |
| 7 | Wave 5 backlog: ADR-121 phases 3-6, ADR-291 23 endpoints, ADR-325 phases 3-5 | multi-sesión by design | Structural backlog. Each is its own arc. | post-audit-cleanup-roadmap.md |

## Items intentionally NOT prioritized

- **Long-tail dormant manifest hygiene (40 items)** — ratio at 20.3% (below 25% target). Further candidate→state flips are bookkeeping, not strategic pressure. Defer until a re-audit shows the ratio creeping back up.
- **45 KEEP-CANDIDATE wiring slice** — same reasoning. The KEEP decisions are operator-confirmed; wiring is a separate ROI question.

## Operational risks to track

| Risk | Trigger | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| SO governance friction-vs-catch ratio unmeasured | This session showed both real wins and SO-generated bugs the SO then caught. No metric distinguishes "guard paid off" from "guard cost more than it caught". | Propose `cos-status --friction-ratio` exposing block-count vs valid-block-count from `agent-audit-trail.jsonl`. |
| Backlog state regeneration manual | This doc is a manual snapshot. Within 1-2 sessions it will drift. | See open architectural question below. |
| Trust-report Wave 3 legacy fallback ambiguity | Parser clamps `uncertainty_count` to `max(count, 1)` for pre-Wave-3 reports. Wave 4 hook design must resolve. | Open question on item #2 above. |

## Open architectural question

**Should `cos-session-state` be a runtime primitive?**

Today: pending work lives across `.cognitive-os/plans/`, engram observations,
git log, manifests, audit reports. The session-start projector (ADR-275)
aggregates several of these for read-time projection, but there is no
write-time consolidator that owns "what's the current backlog after the
last session". This document fills that gap by hand.

Candidates:
- Extend the ADR-275 projector with a `--backlog` mode that ranks open work
  by ROI heuristics (effort × strategic-pressure × blast-radius).
- Add a `session-wrapup` skill output that updates a canonical
  `docs/06-Daily/reports/current-backlog.md` on every wrapup.
- Accept manual snapshots as the design and document the cadence
  (e.g. weekly post-session backlog refresh).

Decision deferred to a future session. ADR-031 + ADR-025 + ADR-059 are
the closest existing decisions but none commit to a canonical
"current pending state" primitive.

## Next-session proposal

1. **Slice X**: DX Tax item #1 cheapest first — lean-profile semantics
   (self-contained, ~3h, closes a Phase 6 checkbox).
2. **Slice Y**: ADR-038 Wave 4 hook wiring (depends on Wave 3 already in
   `0c2f18ba`; deferred legacy-fallback question resolved as part of it).

Disjoint, parallelizable, completable in 1-2h each.
