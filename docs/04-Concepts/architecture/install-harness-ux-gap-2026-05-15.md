# Install Harness UX Gap Review — 2026-05-15

## Question

Does the top-level installer communicate and expose the same multi-IDE ambition
that the underlying Cognitive OS projector already supports?

## Short answer

Partially. `scripts/cos_init.py` is the stronger contract today: it supports a
broad set of native and structural harness projections and records the selected
harness in `.cognitive-os/install-meta.json`. Before this review, `install.sh`
accepted and documented only `claude|codex`, so first-run UX under-claimed the
project's actual projection work.

This gap has two layers:

1. **Immediate mismatch** — `install.sh --harness` did not expose the harnesses
   already implemented in `scripts/cos_init.py`.
2. **Product capability gap** — COS still lacks a Claude-Code-Templates-style
   granular primitive catalog UX (`cos install primitive ...`, `cos install
   profile ...`, `cos project --harness ...`).

## Current state after the first correction

`install.sh` now accepts the same user-facing harness set that `cos_init.py`
projects today:

- `claude`
- `codex`
- `agents-md`
- `opencode`
- `vscode-copilot`
- `cursor`
- `qwen-code`
- `kimi-code`
- `gemini-cli`
- `warp`
- `amp-code`
- `jetbrains-junie`
- `qoder`
- `factory-droid`
- `cline`
- `continue-dev`
- `kilo-code`
- `zed-ai`
- `augment-code`
- `goose`
- `aider`
- `shell-ci`

The installer summary now handles structural harnesses generically: it reads the
actual `settings_driver` from `.cognitive-os/install-meta.json`, points skills to
the canonical `.cognitive-os/skills/cos/` surface, and warns the operator to check
`manifests/harness-projection.yaml` before claiming runtime enforcement.

A new integration smoke covers `install.sh --from <source> --force
--harness=cursor` and verifies `.cursor/rules/cognitive-os.mdc`, `.cursor/mcp.json`,
canonical skills, and absence of Claude-specific skill/instruction leakage.

The next recommended correction is also landed: `tests/integration/test_installer.py`
now compares `install.sh`'s `SUPPORTED_HARNESSES` with
`scripts/cos_init.py::SUPPORTED_HARNESSES`, so future drift fails in CI.

## Findings

### 1. `cos_init.py` is already the public projection contract in practice

`cos_init.py` owns:

- supported harness identifiers;
- settings/instruction output paths;
- native vs structural harness split;
- canonical copy into `.cognitive-os/{hooks,rules,skills,templates}/cos`;
- Claude-only driver projections into `.claude/skills` and `.claude/rules/cos`;
- install metadata, including `harness` and `settings_driver`.

The top-level installer should remain a source/bootstrap wrapper around that
contract, not a competing harness registry.

### 2. `install.sh` duplicates the harness list, but drift is now tested

The immediate fix uses a bash `SUPPORTED_HARNESSES` list matching `cos_init.py`.
That closes UX today. The drift risk is now covered by a permanent integration
test that parses both files and fails when the lists diverge. A future cleanup can
still replace the duplicate list with a shared generated registry.

### 3. Shell and Go helper support now preserve structural harness metadata

`scripts/_lib/settings-driver.sh` now accepts all currently implemented
`cos_init.py` harness IDs from `.cognitive-os/install-meta.json` and maps their
settings/instruction driver paths instead of falling back to `.claude/settings.json`.
The Go package installer helper `cmd/cos/internal/installer/settings_driver.go`
now performs the same metadata-first resolution and includes structural driver
paths.

This closes the immediate helper/update parity bug for structural harnesses;
further work should move both helper implementations to a shared generated
registry rather than maintaining parallel maps.

### 4. `generate-project-settings.sh` is intentionally native-lifecycle only

`generate-project-settings.sh` supports `claude|codex` because it emits native
hook settings. Structural harnesses are handled in `cos_init.py` by writing
instruction/rule/MCP-placeholder surfaces. This split is correct, but the docs
and helper errors should call it out as "native lifecycle settings" rather than
"the harness list".

### 5. Devin remains planned, not implemented

`manifests/harness-projection.yaml` marks Devin as planned. It is not in
`cos_init.py`'s supported harness list. That is the right honest posture until a
project-local Devin projection driver and proof exist.

## Claude Code Templates pattern extraction

`davila7/claude-code-templates` should influence COS UX, not source-of-truth
architecture.

| Upstream pattern | COS treatment |
|---|---|
| `--agent`, `--command`, `--hook`, `--skill`, `--mcp`, `--setting` individual installation flags | Reinterpret as `cos install primitive <family/name> --harness <id>` over COS canonical primitive registry. |
| Component inventory under `cli-tool/components/*` | Keep COS canonical inventory in manifests and primitive directories; do not move truth into `.claude/*`. |
| Backup/merge/conflict handling in `file-operations.js` | Adopt clean-room for projection writers. |
| Health/stats dashboards | Wrap existing COS audits and manifests behind simpler operator commands. |
| Direct `.claude/*` writes as the product model | Do not adopt; `.claude` is a driver target only. |

## Recommended roadmap

### Slice A — installer exposure parity (closed for first-run UX)

- [x] Allow `install.sh --harness=<implemented structural harness>`.
- [x] Update help text to show non-Claude/Codex harnesses.
- [x] Make summary generic for structural harnesses.
- [x] Add `install.sh --harness=cursor` smoke.
- [x] Add drift test: `install.sh` supported list equals `cos_init.py::SUPPORTED_HARNESSES`.
- [x] Update shell settings-driver helper to preserve structural harness metadata
      instead of defaulting unknown harnesses to Claude.
- [x] Update Go package-installer settings-driver helper to preserve structural
      harness metadata.

### Slice B — projection-driver truth source

- [x] Introduce a machine-readable harness registry generated from
      `manifests/harness-projection.yaml` and consumed by Go/Python projection UX.
- [ ] Make `install.sh --help` render the list from that registry.
- [ ] Make helper scripts resolve `settings_driver` from `.cognitive-os/install-meta.json`
      for every harness.
- [ ] Keep `generate-project-settings.sh` explicitly scoped to native lifecycle
      emitters (`claude|codex`) unless another harness gains native hooks.

### Slice C — granular primitive catalog UX (first CLI slice landed)

- [x] Define `cos install primitive <family/name> --harness <id>` as a
      source-of-truth-first projection plan over canonical skill/hook/rule
      surfaces.
- [x] Define `cos install profile <profile> --harness <id>` as a projection plan
      over registered `default|full` profiles, with explicit guidance when a
      named profile such as `sre` is not registered yet.
- [x] Define `cos project --harness <id>` as a project projection plan command.
- [x] Every primitive/profile/project plan says the target path and proof summary
      (`native-lifecycle`, `governed-wrapper-enforced`, or `structural-advisory`).
- [x] Promote the plan commands to first mutation commands with projection
      receipts, target backups, and opt-in runtime smoke. Profile registry
      signing remains a follow-up hardening item.
- [ ] Replace the hardcoded Go harness/proof maps with a generated registry from
      `manifests/harness-projection.yaml` and `manifests/primitive-projection-profiles.yaml`.

### Slice D — conflict-safe projection writes

- [x] Add first-slice backups for existing primitive targets and harness projection files.
- [ ] Preserve bounded COS blocks idempotently.
- [ ] Merge JSON settings where supported and refuse unsafe overwrites.
- [x] Emit a projection receipt under `.cognitive-os/receipts/`.

### Slice E — simple health/stats UX

- [x] Add `cos doctor harness` for proof level, projection paths, receipts, backups,
      and runtime-smoke status summaries.
- [ ] Add `cos primitive stats --harness <id>` to report native/enforced/advisory
      primitive counts.
- [ ] Link counts back to `manifests/harness-projection.yaml` proof levels.

## Acceptance criteria for closing the gap

1. [x] `install.sh --help` and `cos_init.py --help` cannot disagree on supported
   first-run harnesses without a failing test.
2. [x] A fresh project can install at least one native harness (`claude`), one hook
   settings harness (`codex`), and one structural harness (`cursor`) through
   top-level `install.sh`.
3. [x] Shell and Go helper/update paths read structural harness install metadata
   instead of assuming Claude.
4. [x] A primitive/profile/project catalog command can plan one skill/profile
   projection with a harness-specific proof-level summary.
5. [x] Devin stays absent from supported first-run harnesses until projection
   files and tests exist, despite being in the planned manifest.
6. [x] Mutation/apply mode for granular primitive/profile commands writes
   backups and receipts, with deeper structured merge still tracked as follow-up.

## Bottom line

The architecture remains correct: `.cognitive-os/` is canonical, `.claude/` is a
projection target, and each harness carries an explicit proof boundary. The
install UX now has first-slice apply mode, but the product-quality close still
requires shared generated harness maps, deeper structured merge semantics, and
a simple doctor/stats wrapper over receipts.

## 2026-05-15 follow-up: apply-mode projection slice

The granular UX has moved beyond plan-only for the first safe slice:

- `cos install primitive <family/name> --harness <id>` now writes the selected
  primitive into `.cognitive-os/{skills,hooks,rules}/cos/`, backs up any existing
  target plus the harness projection file, and emits a JSON receipt under
  `.cognitive-os/receipts/`.
- `cos install profile default|full --harness <id>` and `cos project --harness
  <id> --profile default|full` now delegate to `scripts/cos_init.py`, back up the
  selected harness projection path first, and emit the same receipt shape.
- All three commands keep `--dry-run` for the previous plan output.
- `--runtime-smoke` is opt-in and runs real installed harness binaries only for
  mapped command-line harnesses (`cursor`, `qwen-code`, `gemini-cli`,
  `opencode`). Missing binaries are recorded as skipped rather than treated as a
  product proof.
- `devin` is explicitly recognized as planned-but-unsupported, so operators
  get an honest error instead of a generic unknown-harness message.

The canonical primitive catalog now has a generated lockfile at
`manifests/agentic-primitive-registry.lock.yaml`. The lockfile is the
canonical generated/locked primitive catalog; harness directories remain
projection targets, not source of truth.

Remaining hardening after this slice:

- keep moving remaining shell/bootstrap harness strings onto the shared registry where safe;
- merge JSON settings structurally instead of backing up then allowing the
  projector to rewrite them;
- add a human-facing `cos doctor harness` summary over projection receipts and
  harness proof levels.

## 2026-05-15 hardening: shared registry, JSON merge, and doctor UX

The next hardening slice replaces duplicated Go/Python harness maps with a
checked-in generated registry:

- Source manifest: `manifests/harness-projection.yaml`.
- Generator: `scripts/generate_harness_projection_registry.py`.
- Runtime registry: `manifests/harness-projection-registry.json`.
- Consumers: `scripts/cos_init.py` and `cmd/cos/internal/cli/harness_projection.go`.

The registry carries implemented harness order, status, primary settings path,
all settings paths, proof level, and optional runtime-smoke command. `install.sh`
still keeps a small shell string for first-run parsing, but integration tests now
prove that shell list equals the shared registry and that `cos_init.py` imports
the same order.

Projection apply mode also now captures existing JSON settings before running the
projector, lets `cos_init.py` emit the COS shape, then merges existing JSON back
in structurally. Object keys are merged recursively and arrays are unioned with
stable identity, preserving user settings while adding COS settings. JSONC files
are backed up but not parsed until a comment-preserving parser is introduced.

A new `cos doctor harness` command reports the active or selected harness,
projection path, proof level, settings paths, projection receipt counts, backup
counts, runtime-smoke status counts, and next action. Use `--json` for machine
readable output.
