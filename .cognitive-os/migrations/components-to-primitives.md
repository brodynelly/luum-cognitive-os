| 55 | "### Carve-out: '**component**' remains valid" (policy section — the heading itself) | B | (no change — this heading announces the carve-out policy; renaming it would contradict the carve-out) |

| 64 | "Writing 'OS **component**' when the referent is a skill or hook is imprecise" | A | "Writing 'OS agentic primitive' when the referent is a skill or hook is imprecise" — wait: this sentence is *teaching* the correct term, not using "component" to mean a primitive. Keep as-is; it is part of the migration rationale itself. | AMBIGUOUS |
| 68 | `tests/audit/test_vocabulary_agentic_primitives.py` will flag "OS **component**" as a drift violation | B | (no change — this is a string literal describing the drift condition to detect) |

### Class B — keep (15)

All instances in `AGENTS.md:55–68` where "component" is used in the carve-out policy definition itself (the policy explaining when "component" remains valid), plus:
- `.claude/plugins/pi-mono/AGENTS.md:64,216` — Ink UI framework components (React/Ink)
- `docs/architecture/cos-vs-project-overlap-analysis.md:13` — `/plan-design-system-component` slash-command (Atomic Design)
- `docs/architecture/project-consumption-patterns.md:48` — "Component architecture (Opus)" for UI/UX in a reference project

### Class C — keep (31)

Grouped by reason:

**Infrastructure/dependencies** (ADR-006, observability):
- `docs/architecture/adrs/006-agpl-license-compliance.md:14,21,31` — Redis, MinIO, software licensing
- `docs/architecture/observability-backend-evaluation-2026-04-24.md:82` — MLflow, Langfuse, Valkey
- `docs/architecture/tooling-stack-rationalization.md:101` — generic tool duplication checklist

**Go software architecture** (cos-dispatch):
- `docs/architecture/cos-dispatch/README.md:38` — Go binary component diagram
- `docs/architecture/cos-dispatch/adr-detection.md:11,152` — Go type headings (ADRDetector, ADRGenerator)
- `docs/architecture/cos-dispatch/adrs/002-transformer-separate-interface.md:28` — Go interface pattern
- `docs/architecture/adrs/026-r2-r3-design-review.md:252` — config loader code modules
- `docs/architecture/adrs/026a-decisions.md:104,107` — config loader code modules

**Test pyramid terminology** (cos-dispatch/test-strategy.md):
- Lines 21, 25, 38, 42, 79, 167 — "Component test" as test layer name (Unit/Component/Integration/Binary)

**CI gate sub-systems** (cross-platform-ci.md):
- Lines 8, 10 — lint script, Docker, smoke suite, Makefile: CI infrastructure

**Procedural install sections** (CHANGELOG.md:104):
- "mode components" = 12 procedural sections in `cos-init.sh`, not agentic primitives

**Generic analysis heading** (cos-update-vs-cos-cli-responsibility-analysis.md:16):
- "## Components Inspected" heading for two bash scripts under analysis

**Table column for a reference-project's features** (cos-vs-project-overlap-analysis.md:7):
- Column header grouping frontend commands and UI features

### Ambiguous (6)

- `AGENTS.md:64` — The sentence teaches the correct term ("OS component" → "OS primitive") but uses "OS component" as the thing to avoid. Keeping the sentence is the right call; it is part of the migration rationale, not a drift violation.
- `README.md:8` — "REAL Components" badge. Badge label tracks health of agentic primitives but is also a metric name that may be referenced in badge JSON URLs. Migrating requires coordinating badge infrastructure.
- `CHANGELOG.md:308` — `/component-reality-check` skill name in a description. The skill name is a proper noun; the description text around it is migratable, but the slash-command itself needs a rename tracked separately.
- `docs/architecture/bootstrap-portability.md:145` — `component-lint.sh` filename in a sentence listing scripts. Prose references a proper noun; the file rename is a separate task.
- `docs/architecture/core-vs-extensions-audit-2026-04-20.md:256` — `component-lint.sh` in a migration plan list. Same as above.
- `docs/architecture/plans-reconciliation-2026-04-21.md:27` — "all have shipped components + ADR" — could be software modules (C) or could include hook implementations (A). Needs author confirmation.

### Estimated total Class A edits: 64

### Separate-pass items (rename tracking required)
These are proper nouns (skill names, filenames, test function names) that need coordinated renaming beyond prose edits:
- Skill: `component-classifier` → `primitive-classifier`
- Skill: `component-reality-check` → `primitive-reality-check`
- Script: `component-lint.sh` → `primitive-lint.sh`
- Rule file: `component-classification.md` → `primitive-classification.md`
- Plan file: `component-scope-classification.md` → `primitive-scope-classification.md`
- Test function: `test_uninstall_removes_cos_components` → `test_uninstall_removes_cos_primitives` (in `tests/`)
- Badge label: `real-components.json` → `real-primitives.json` (coordinate with badge infrastructure)
- CLI arg: `cos map [component]` → `cos map [primitive]` (requires Go source edit in `cmd/cos/`)
