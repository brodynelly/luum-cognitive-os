# Hooks — Runtime Interceptors

Hooks are shell scripts that fire at specific points in the Claude Code session lifecycle. They are configured in `.claude/settings.json` and live in `hooks/` (94 scripts total; 46 registered in `settings.json`).

## 1. Stack Detector (`stack-detector.sh`)

**When**: Runs once at session start.

**What it does**: Scans the project directory for technology markers and generates `.claude/detected-stack.json`.

**Detection logic**:

| Technology | How Detected |
|------------|-------------|
| Node.js | `package.json` exists or `mobile/` directory |
| TypeScript | `tsconfig.json` found (max depth 3) |
| NestJS | `@nestjs/core` in any package.json |
| Express | `"express"` in any package.json |
| React Native / Expo | `react-native` or `expo` in `mobile/app/package.json` |
| Jest | `"jest"` in any package.json |
| Go | `go.mod` found (max depth 3) |
| Java / Spring Boot | `build.gradle` or `pom.xml` found; `spring-boot` in gradle files |
| Solidity / Hardhat | `hardhat.config.*` found |
| Docker | `docker-compose.yml` at root |
| MongoDB, MySQL, Redis, RabbitMQ | Referenced in `docker-compose*.yml` |
| Clean Architecture | `domain/` + `infrastructure/` or `usecases/` directories |
| WireMock, TestContainers | Referenced in `services/` |

**Output**: JSON file at `.claude/detected-stack.json` with boolean flags per technology.

**How to modify**: Add new detection blocks following the existing pattern: check for files/patterns, set `DETECTED[key]=true`.

---

## 2. Block Production URLs (`block-prod-urls.sh`)

**When**: Before every Bash command execution (PreToolUse).

**What it does**: Inspects the command string for production domain patterns. If found, returns a JSON deny decision that blocks the command.

**Blocked patterns**:
- `example.com` (and `api.example.com`, `admin.example.com`)
- `prod.example.*`
- `production.example.*`
- `example.com.ar`

**Response on match**:
```json
{"decision": "deny", "reason": "Blocked: production URL detected. Use localhost for local development."}
```

**How to modify**: Edit the `grep -qiE` regex on line 14 to add/remove patterns.

---

## 3. Auto Test on Edit (`auto-test-on-edit.sh`)

**When**: After every Edit or Write tool use (PostToolUse).

**What it does**: Detects which service was affected by the file edit and runs (or suggests running) the appropriate tests.

**Behavior per service**:

| Service | Path Pattern | Action |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| example-users | `services/example-users/` | Reminder only (Java too slow for auto-run) |
| example-auth | `services/example-auth/` | Reminder only (Java too slow for auto-run) |
| onboarding | `services/onboarding/` | `npx jest --changedSince=HEAD` |
| example-bff | `mobile/example-bff/` | `npx jest --changedSince=HEAD` |
| example-gateway | `services/example-gateway/` | `npx jest --changedSince=HEAD` |
| accounts-go | `wallet/accounts-go/` | `go test ./... -short` |
| mobile app | `mobile/app/` | Reminder only |

**Skipped files**: `.md`, `.json`, `.yml`, `.yaml`, `.env`, `.lock`, `.gitignore`

**How to modify**: Add new `elif` blocks matching file path patterns to service-specific test commands.

---

## 4. Skill Feedback Tracker (`skill-feedback-tracker.sh`)

**When**: After every Agent or Skill tool use (PostToolUse).

**What it does**: Reads the tool result via stdin (JSON). If the exit code is non-zero or the result contains error keywords, saves a feedback observation to Engram.

**Failure detection**:
1. Non-zero exit code
2. Result text contains: `error`, `failed`, `rejected`, `exception`, `timed out`, `permission denied`

**On failure**: POSTs to Engram HTTP API (`localhost:7437`) with:
- Title: `Skill feedback: {skill-name} failed`
- Type: `discovery`
- Topic key: `skill-feedback/{skill-name}`
- Content: skill name, failure reason, result excerpt (first 500 chars)

**Integration with skill-adaptation rule**: The `skill-adaptation.md` rule reads these Engram observations before running any skill. After 3+ failures for the same skill, it recommends running `/skill-creator` to rewrite the skill.

**How to modify**: Adjust the grep patterns for failure detection or change the Engram port via `ENGRAM_PORT` env var.

## Hook Configuration in settings.json

46 hooks are registered in `.claude/settings.json`. The structure groups hooks by lifecycle event and matcher. Example showing selected hooks:

## Hook Composition (Inter-Hook Data Sharing)

Hooks within the same event chain can pass structured data to downstream hooks
via `hooks/_lib/hook-pipe.sh`. This enables context-aware decisions: for
example, `clarification-gate.sh` emits its ambiguity score so that
`blast-radius.sh` can lower its HIGH-radius threshold when the prompt is vague.

### Library: `hooks/_lib/hook-pipe.sh`

Source this library in any hook that needs to produce or consume pipe data:

```bash
source "$(dirname "$0")/_lib/hook-pipe.sh"
```

**Functions**:

| Function | Signature | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| `hook_emit` | `hook_emit <key> <value> [event]` | Write a value for downstream hooks in the same event |
| `hook_read` | `hook_read <key> [default] [event]` | Read a value emitted by a prior hook; returns default if absent |
| `hook_pipe_clear` | `hook_pipe_clear [event]` | Clear pipe values (all events, or a specific event) |

**Storage**: Values are written to `.cognitive-os/.hook-pipe/<event>-<key>.val`.
Each file holds one line (newlines in values are collapsed to spaces).

**Key naming**: Keys must match `^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*$`. Use descriptive
names like `clarification_score`, `blast_radius_level`.

**Lifecycle**: Pipe files persist for the duration of the session. They are
NOT automatically cleared between invocations — hooks that need a clean slate
should call `hook_pipe_clear` at the start of each PreToolUse invocation.

### Active pipe data flows

| Producer | Key | Event | Consumer | Effect |
|----------|-----|-------|----------|--------|
| `clarification-gate.sh` | `clarification_score` | `PreToolUse` | `blast-radius.sh` | Lowers HIGH threshold from 40→20 when score ≥ 30 |

### Adding a new pipe data flow

1. In the producer hook, source hook-pipe.sh and call `hook_emit`:
   ```bash
   source "$(dirname "$0")/_lib/hook-pipe.sh"
   hook_emit "my_score" "$MY_SCORE" "PreToolUse"
   ```
2. In the consumer hook (must run after the producer), source and call `hook_read`:
   ```bash
   source "$(dirname "$0")/_lib/hook-pipe.sh"
   MY_SCORE=$(hook_read "my_score" "0" "PreToolUse")
   ```
3. Ensure the producer is registered before the consumer in `settings.json`.
4. Document the new flow in the table above.
