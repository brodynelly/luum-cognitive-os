# Catalog Full

## Purpose

Session-start only loads the compact catalog (`skills/CATALOG-COMPACT.md`, ~2K tokens,
name + 1-line description). When you need the full catalog — invocations, audience
columns, section groupings, loading protocol notes, project-specific skill examples —
invoke this skill to load `skills/CATALOG.md` on demand.

## Trigger

- User asks for the full skills catalog, invocation syntax, or where a skill is grouped.
- The compact catalog does not have enough detail to answer the question.
- User invokes `/catalog-full` directly.

## Inputs

None. The catalog is a static file.

## Protocol

1. Read `skills/CATALOG.md` from the project root.
2. Render the relevant section, or if the user asked a targeted question, extract only
   the rows and notes that match.
3. Do NOT keep the full catalog loaded after the request is answered — unload once the
   specific question is resolved. This keeps Level-1 overhead low.

## Outputs

- The requested section(s) of `skills/CATALOG.md`, or
- A brief answer citing the catalog entries that match the user's question.

## Notes

- The full catalog is ~7K tokens. Only load it when needed.
- If the skill the user is asking about is missing from both `CATALOG.md` and
  `CATALOG-COMPACT.md`, run `python3 scripts/generate-compact-catalog.py` to
  regenerate the compact catalog from SKILL.md frontmatter.
- The compact catalog groups skills by audience (`os`, `os-dev`, `both`, `project`).
  The full catalog groups by theme (Universal, Pre-Development, Caveman, Trail of Bits,
  Project Skills, etc.). Use whichever grouping is more useful for the question.
