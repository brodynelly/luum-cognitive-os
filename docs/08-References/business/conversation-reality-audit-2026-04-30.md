# Conversation Reality Audit — 2026-04-30

> Investigation plan for validating whether Cognitive OS is real daily leverage or an overgrown aspirational system.

## Purpose

The conversation raises the right product risk: Cognitive OS may contain a real core, but its surface area can make it hard to know which pieces actually fire, which pieces merely exist, and which pieces improve developer work enough to justify their cognitive cost.

This audit turns that concern into measurable evidence. It does not treat documentation, file existence, or claimed architecture as proof. A primitive is counted as real only when it has runtime wiring, behavioral evidence, and a user-visible outcome.

## Questions Under Review

1. Which capabilities are real behavior versus aspirational or dormant assets?
2. How efficient is the system for normal day-to-day development?
3. How friendly is the developer experience for both maintainers and new adopters?
4. Which developer pains does the system remove, and which pains does it create?
5. How automatic is the system in practice, without hidden manual rituals?
6. Where is Cognitive OS materially better or worse than prior alternatives such as Hermes, OpenClaw, and vanilla harness workflows?

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Each major product claim is classified as `proven`, `partial`, `aspirational`, or `harmful-overhead` with concrete evidence.
2. Every `proven` claim has at least one runtime path and one behavioral test or captured metric.
3. Every `aspirational` claim names the file, hook, skill, rule, or doc that makes the unsupported claim.
4. Daily-development cost is measured with wall-clock latency, tool-call count, hook count, and token/context payload estimates.
5. DX findings include at least one maintainer workflow and one fresh-adopter workflow.
6. Competitive comparison is based on actual installed behavior or documented prior-art findings, not product-language preference.
7. The final report recommends deletion, demotion, packaging, or hardening for each high-cost surface.

## Initial Evidence Snapshot

These measurements were taken from the working tree on 2026-04-30.

| Signal | Result | Interpretation |
|---|---:|---|
| `dogfood_score.py --json` overall | 65.22 / 100 | The system is substantive but not mature enough for broad top-level claims. |
| Hook wiring | 76 / 165 registered and tested | Less than half of hook files have both runtime registration and test references. |
| Skill coverage | 35 / 143 by dogfood heuristic | Skill catalog is much larger than its direct behavioral proof surface. |
| Harness portability | 268 / 495 clean files | `.claude` / `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` gravity is still significant. |
| Metrics JSONL files | 72 non-empty / 94 total | Many subsystems emit evidence, but 22 metric streams are empty. |
| Hook timing events | p50 324 ms, p95 1622 ms, max 13332 ms | Latency is now measurable; p95 hook cost is meaningful for turn feel. |
| `skill-feedback-tracker.sh` | registered in `.claude/settings.json` now | The earlier detached-hook claim appears historically true but needs current-status phrasing. |

## Audit Model

### Classification Labels

- `proven`: registered or invoked, exercised by behavioral tests, and producing durable runtime evidence.
- `partial`: implemented and partly wired, but missing either consumption, tests, metrics, or user-visible closure.
- `aspirational`: documented or present on disk, but no live invocation path or behavioral proof.
- `harmful-overhead`: real behavior whose runtime, cognitive, or maintenance cost exceeds observed value.

### Evidence Hierarchy

1. Runtime invocation observed in settings, hook timing, JSONL metrics, or command output.
2. Behavioral test that executes the path and checks side effects.
3. Integration with a consumer that uses the emitted signal.
4. Documentation or ADR only.
5. File existence only.

Documentation and file existence are supporting context, not proof.

## Workstream A — Hype Versus Behavior

### Method

1. Inventory hooks, skills, rules, scripts, libs, templates, dashboards, and squads.
2. For each item, compute:
   - declared purpose
   - invocation path
   - consumer path
   - metric output
   - behavioral tests
   - last meaningful activity
3. Build a `reality matrix` with the classification labels above.
4. Flag contradiction patterns:
   - documented in README but not registered
   - registered but never emits metrics
   - emits metrics but nobody consumes them
   - tests only check existence or metadata
   - ADR says accepted but implementation is absent or stale

### Commands

```bash
uv run python3 scripts/dogfood_score.py --json
python3 scripts/cos_test_quality_audit.py --json
python3 -m pytest tests/audit/ -q
python3 -m pytest tests/contracts/ -q
```

### Outputs

- `docs/06-Daily/reports/reality-matrix-2026-04.md`
- deletion/demotion candidates grouped by primitive type
- list of product claims that need wording changes

## Workstream B — Daily Efficiency Baseline

### Method

Measure a realistic loop, not isolated scripts:

1. start session
2. inspect context
3. edit one small file
4. run focused validation
5. run broad-enough validation
6. produce summary or commit-ready state

Capture:

- wall-clock time
- hook invocations
- p50/p95 hook latency
- total tool calls
- context payload estimate
- number of user-visible interruptions
- number of manual recovery steps

### Scenarios

| Scenario | Purpose |
|---|---|
| vanilla Codex or Claude Code, no COS | control baseline |
| COS default profile | expected daily path |
| COS full profile | upper-bound governance cost |
| self-hosting repo | worst-case internal dogfood |
| fresh client repo | adoption reality |

### Outputs

- `docs/06-Daily/reports/dx-efficiency-baseline-2026-04.md`
- recommended default profile limits
- hooks to disable, merge, or make async

## Workstream C — Developer Experience

### Maintainer DX Checks

- Can a maintainer find the right skill without grep?
- Can a hook be added without hand-editing multiple projection files?
- Can parallel ADR work avoid number collisions?
- Can symlinked libs and generated projections be understood by subagents without repeated prompting?
- Can failures explain what blocked and how to fix it?

### Fresh-Adopter DX Checks

- Can a new project install core safely?
- Can the user see which hooks are active versus available?
- Can the user understand optional packages without reading the whole repo?
- Can the user remove or downgrade noisy rules?
- Can the user run one command that proves the system works?

### Outputs

- DX friction table with severity and fix owner
- onboarding proof checklist update
- candidate CLI UX improvements

## Workstream D — Pain Removed Versus Pain Added

### Pain Removed Ledger

For each claimed benefit, require a before-and-after story:

| Pain | COS mechanism | Evidence required |
|---|---|---|
| lost context across sessions | Engram / memory lifecycle | recovered decision in a new session |
| agents say done too early | acceptance criteria / completion gates | blocked or corrected premature completion |
| unsafe edits | pre-tool hooks / policy gates | prevented destructive or secret-touching action |
| model churn | provider normalization / harness drivers | same contract across two harnesses or providers |
| test sprawl | `cos-test` lanes | focused validation selects useful subset |

### Pain Added Ledger

Track costs the system itself introduces:

- hook-chain latency
- catalog lookup friction
- ADR coordination collisions
- noisy governance prompts
- generated-file confusion
- optional service setup complexity
- false-positive blocks

### Output

A net-value table: `removed`, `added`, `net`, `recommended action`.

## Workstream E — Automagic Reality

### Automation Maturity Scale

1. `manual`: user must know and run the command.
2. `assisted`: system suggests the command but does not execute safely.
3. `wired`: hook or workflow fires automatically.
4. `closed-loop`: emitted signal is consumed by another primitive.
5. `self-correcting`: system verifies outcome and repairs or escalates.

Each automagic claim must be placed on this scale.

### Focus Areas

- memory persistence and retrieval
- rule tier expansion
- hook profile projection
- feedback loop closure
- auto-rollback and auto-refine
- skill discovery and routing
- ADR numbering and governance

## Workstream F — Alternatives and Prior-Art Comparison

### Comparison Axes

- governance strength
- progressive disclosure
- skill discoverability
- memory model
- cross-harness portability
- setup complexity
- daily latency
- proof quality
- deletion discipline

### Required Comparisons

- vanilla Claude Code / Codex
- Hermes Agent
- OpenClaw
- relevant prior tools already captured in research logs

### Output

A scored comparison matrix with explicit `COS wins`, `COS loses`, and `uncertain` cells.

## Decision Rules

| Finding | Action |
|---|---|
| proven and high-value | keep core and improve docs/demo |
| proven but noisy | make configurable, async, or profile-gated |
| partial with clear value | harden with consumer, metric, and behavioral test |
| partial with low value | demote to optional package or archive |
| aspirational and user-facing | remove from product story until proven |
| aspirational and internal-only | archive or mark experimental |
| harmful-overhead | delete, merge, or disable by default |

## Final Report Shape

The final report should answer in this order:

1. One-page verdict: real core, inflated surface, top risks.
2. Scorecard across the six user questions.
3. Evidence table for the most important claims.
4. Delete/demote/harden recommendations.
5. Default-profile changes that reduce daily friction.
6. Claims that marketing/docs must stop making.
7. Next measurement cadence.

## Current Working Verdict

Cognitive OS appears real but overgrown. The strongest evidence supports governance, verification, memory continuity, and portability work. The weakest evidence is around broad automagic claims, large skill/rule catalogs, and advanced remediation loops. The next best move is not another feature sprint; it is a reality-reduction sprint that measures, deletes, demotes, or hardens every high-cost surface.

### Growth Prevention Principle

The audit is not only retrospective. New OS growth should satisfy a prevention rule:

> A new agentic primitive must add at least proportional evidence: runtime wiring, behavioral proof, metric ownership, and a consumer or explicit optional-package boundary.

The weekly primitive-gap workflow now enforces this at family level by comparing each snapshot with the previous tracked baseline. It fails on regressions such as:

- overall risk worsening;
- family severity worsening;
- proven signal decreasing;
- aspirational signal increasing;
- unproven surface area growing;
- hook p95 latency regressing beyond the configured tolerance.

This keeps current known debt visible while preventing the SO from growing new unverified surface by default.

### 13. Periodic Automation

- [x] Add a repository script that generates a primitive gap snapshot from current repo evidence.
- [x] Append periodic snapshots to `docs/06-Daily/reports/primitive-gap-history.jsonl` in CI, or `.cognitive-os/metrics/primitive-gap-snapshot.jsonl` for local runs.
- [x] Generate a latest Markdown report at `docs/06-Daily/reports/primitive-gap-latest.md`.
- [x] Add a scheduled GitHub Actions workflow for weekly primitive gap snapshots.
- [x] Add regression-based escalation so new primitive gaps fail against the tracked baseline.
- [x] Wire row-level primitive audit, claim-to-proof audit, and reduction backlog generation into the weekly workflow.
- [x] Block unmapped strong product claims in the weekly workflow via `claim_proof_audit.py --fail-unmapped`.
- [x] Block any non-zero reduction backlog in the weekly workflow via `reduction_backlog.py --fail-nonzero`.
- [ ] Add issue/PR creation for new blocker/high regressions.
- [x] Add row-level hook audit automation beyond family-level snapshot.

### 14. Documentation Reinvention / Duplicate Drift

- [x] Verify existing reinvention barrier scope (`hooks/reinvention-check.sh`).
- [x] Confirm current barrier is code/file-creation oriented and advisory, not a complete documentation duplicate guard.
- [x] Add automated near-duplicate Markdown scan.
- [x] Store current duplicate-doc baseline at `docs/06-Daily/reports/docs-duplicate-baseline.json`.
- [x] Fail weekly audit on new duplicate documentation pairs versus baseline.
- [ ] Add row-level doc claim ownership so agents know which existing doc to update instead of creating another.
- [x] Add pre-write hook guidance for docs creation prompts: search/update before create.

### 15. Provenance and Concurrent-Session Coordination

- [x] Confirm commit provenance trailers were not previously enforced.
- [x] Add `prepare-commit-msg` provenance trailers for session, harness, and origin kind.
- [x] Test provenance through a real temporary git repository commit, not only a string formatter.
- [x] Confirm ADR number reservation was not previously protected by a lock.
- [x] Add atomic ADR reservation records with owner/session/TTL/path metadata.
- [x] Test ADR reservations under concurrent subprocesses to prove cross-process locking behavior.
- [x] Add a pre-write ADR guard that warns when an ADR file is created without a matching active reservation.
- [x] Add a cleanup/report command for expired ADR reservations.

### 16. Reduction Batch Closure

- [x] Resolve P1 `delete-or-wire` hook rows by separating dormant-tested hooks, projected profile hooks, and optional package aliases from truly dead surface.
- [x] Add behavior tests for registered/projection hooks that lacked row-level proof: `dequeue-notify.sh`, `memory-prefetch.sh`, `profile-drift-autoapply.sh`, and `skill-frontmatter-validator.sh`.
- [x] Resolve P2 weak claims by demoting overconfident product wording and filtering code/config fragments that are not product claims.
- [x] Record optional/dormant P2 primitive demotions in `manifests/reduction-demotions.json`.
- [x] Add skill/rule runtime contract tests so loaded skills and rules have real audit coverage.
- [x] Regenerate reduction backlog to zero current items.

### 17. Hook Surface Reduction

- [x] Add a family-specific hook surface reducer with plan/apply-safe modes.
- [x] Apply safe hook reduction for demoted, unregistered, untested root hooks.
- [x] Move safe hook removals to `archive/primitive-surface/hooks/` instead of deleting them.
- [x] Generate a durable surface reduction report at `docs/06-Daily/reports/primitive-surface-reduction-latest.md`.
- [x] Wire the weekly primitive gap workflow to refresh the hook surface reduction plan.
- [ ] Review optional symlink aliases with package owners before removing aliases.

### 18. Primitive Usage / Consumer Coverage

- [x] Add a static consumer map for Python scripts and other primitive families.
- [x] Generate `docs/06-Daily/reports/primitive-usage-map-latest.md` and JSON from `scripts/primitive_usage_map.py`.
- [x] Wire the weekly primitive gap workflow to refresh the scripts usage map.
- [x] Add an OS-only `/primitive-usage-map` skill so maintainers can ask which skills/hooks/rules/tests/docs consume each primitive.
- [x] Add an OS-only `/primitive-surface-reduction` skill that wraps the reducer and keeps it out of target projects.
- [ ] Extend the weekly workflow to emit separate usage maps for hooks, skills, and rules once baseline noise is triaged.
- [ ] Decide whether scripts with no skill consumer need a new skill, explicit internal-only ownership, or archival.
