## 1. Persistent Memory (Engram)

Your AI assistant forgets everything when the session ends. Cognitive OS solves this.

**How it works:**
- Engram provides persistent, searchable memory across all sessions via the MCP protocol
- Automatic save triggers fire after decisions, bug fixes, discoveries, and conventions
- Full-text search (FTS5) over all past observations
- Session summaries are automatically saved before each session close and context compaction
- Topic keys organize knowledge hierarchically (e.g., `architecture/auth-model`, `sre-fix/mysql/connection-refused`)
- Private mode disables all persistence for sensitive conversations

**What exists today:**
- Engram MCP server
- Proactive save protocol with 4 trigger categories
- Session close protocol ensuring no knowledge is lost
- Post-compaction recovery
- Git-based sync for shared knowledge bases

---

## 2. Spec-Driven Development (SDD)

Complex features need planning, not just code.

**10 phases with dependency tracking:**
```
init --> explore --> propose --> spec --+--> tasks --> apply --> verify --> archive
                                       |
                                       +--> design
```

**Adaptive intelligence:**

| Complexity | Signal | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Trivial | One file, < 20 lines | Do it directly, no workflow |
| Small | 1-3 files, one service | Lightweight proposal |
| Medium | Multi-file, one service | SDD from proposal through apply |
| Large | Multi-service, new integration | Full SDD pipeline |
| Critical | Security, auth, payments | Full SDD with mandatory verification |

**What exists today:**
- 9 SDD phase skills
- OpenSpec alternative (4 skills for lighter change tracking)
- Engram-backed artifact persistence
- Orchestrator protocol for multi-agent SDD execution

---

## 3. Quality Control

Quality gates enforced by infrastructure, not by hope.

**Constitutional gates (7 example immutable rules):**
1. Mobile never talks directly to microservices (always through the BFF)
2. Mock before integrating (no external vendor without a mock)
3. Tests before merging (all new code must have tests)
4. Secrets never in code (always environment variables)
5. Backward-compatible APIs (no breaking changes without a version bump)
6. Idempotent financial operations (via transaction IDs)
7. Audit trails for all critical operations

**Additional enforcement:**
- Control manifest: forbidden zones, performance constraints, security constraints
- License policy: automatically blocks AGPL, SSPL, BSL, ELv2 dependencies
- 21 hooks that fire at runtime (SessionStart, PreToolUse, PostToolUse)
- Configurable coverage thresholds per industry (80% fintech, 90% healthcare, 50% startup MVP)

**What exists today:**
- 19 rule files covering architecture, security, testing, licensing, fault tolerance, and more
- 21 hook scripts enforcing rules at runtime
- 3 security hooks: block-dangerous.sh, protect-env-files.sh, audit-commands.sh
- Coverage gate hook with configurable thresholds

---

## 4. Self-Improvement Loop

The system gets smarter with every session.

```
Agents execute tasks
    |
    v
Hooks capture: metrics (tokens, time, cost) + errors (test/lint/build)
    |
    v
Pattern detector injects warnings into upcoming agents
    |
    v
/error-analyzer proposes skill updates
    |
    v
/model-optimizer adjusts model routing
    |
    v
/agent-kpis measures everything with 20 KPIs across 5 OKRs
    |
    v
Improved skills --> more efficient agents --> KPIs improve --> closed loop
```

**Components:**
- **Error learning**: Automatic capture of test, lint, and build failures
- **Pattern detection**: 3+ similar errors within 24h trigger warnings
- **Skill adaptation**: After 3+ failures, suggests skill rewrite
- **Automatic skill generation**: Complex solutions are converted into reusable skills
- **Model routing optimization**: Adjusts which model handles which task based on performance
- **Agent KPIs**: 20 metrics across 5 OKRs (quality, efficiency, self-improvement, velocity, security)

---

## 5. Multi-Agent Orchestration

Coordinate multiple AI agents working in parallel without conflicts.

**How it works:**
- Orchestrator pattern: one coordinator delegates work to specialized sub-agents
- Sub-agents receive isolated context with pre-resolved skill references
- Task registration and tracking via active-tasks.json
- Fault tolerance: crashed agents are detected and relaunched
- Idempotent execution: agents verify whether work already exists

**Proven scale:**
- 12+ simultaneous agents
- 100+ total launches in a single session
- Each agent receives accumulated knowledge from Engram

**Fault tolerance (4-tier model):**
1. Connection resilience (reconnection, heartbeat, graceful shutdown)
2. LLM call resilience (auth rotation, rate limit detection, model fallback)
3. Context resilience (pre-compaction flush to Engram, session summary)
4. Agent resilience (orphan detection, parent notification, relaunch)

---

## 6. Security and Compliance

Enterprise-grade security built into the infrastructure.

**Defense layers:**
- **NeMo Guardrails** (NVIDIA, Apache 2.0): Conversational guardrails — jailbreak detection, topic controls
- **Constitutional gates**: Immutable rules that no agent or prompt can override
- **Production URL blocking**: Hook that prevents accidental interactions with production systems
- **Credential management**: API keys only in environment variables, startup validation, rotation tracking
- **Agent identity system**: Trust levels (0-3), audit trails, monotonic permission attenuation
- **Private mode**: Zero-persistence mode for sensitive conversations
- **License compliance**: Automatic blocking of incompatible dependencies
- **Dangerous command blocking**: Prevents rm -rf, force push, DROP TABLE, docker push to production

**Identity stack (6 layers, designed):**
1. Cryptographic identity (Ed25519 + post-quantum)
2. Credential vault (runtime secret injection)
3. Permissions (YAML-based policy engine)
4. Cross-agent discovery (A2A Agent Cards)
5. Delegation (monotonic attenuation)
6. Infrastructure identity (SPIFFE/SPIRE)

---

## 7. Observability and Cost Control

Know exactly what your AI is doing and how much it costs.

**Observability:**
- **Langfuse** (MIT): LLM engineering platform — traces, prompts, evaluations, cost tracking
- **Skill metrics**: Per-skill tracking of tokens, time, cost, and model used
- **Agent KPIs**: 20 metrics across 5 OKRs with configurable alert thresholds

**Cost control:**
- **LiteLLM** (MIT): OpenAI-compatible proxy for 100+ LLM providers — budget caps, virtual keys, rate limiting
- **Model routing**: Automatic selection of the right model per task
- **Budget alerts**: Configurable warnings and caps

---

## 8. Developer Experience

A rich ecosystem of specialized capabilities available out of the box.

| Component | Count | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Skills (project) | 27 | /sdd-new, /coverage-report, /sre-agent, /error-analyzer, /model-optimizer |
| Skills (global) | 15+ | SDD phases (9), skill-creator, skill-registry, go-testing, webapp-testing |
| Hooks | 21 | auto-test-on-edit, error-learning, block-dangerous, coverage-gate |
| Rules | 19 | constitutional-gates, license-policy, sre-protocol, model-routing |
| Agent personas | 16+ | security-engineer, code-reviewer, software-architect, DBA, SRE |

**Progressive skill loading:**
1. **Always loaded**: Rules (19) — active constraints
2. **On demand**: Skills — loaded when invoked by name
3. **Auto-detected**: Stack-specific skills generated based on detected technologies

- Known fixes stored in Engram
- Safe actions executed automatically (restart container, clear cache)
- Unsafe actions require human approval
- 4-tier escalation policy

---

## 11. Industry Presets (Plugin System)

| Industry | Key Rules | Target Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| Fintech | PCI compliance, audit trails, idempotent operations | 80% |
| Healthcare | HIPAA data handling, consent management, audit logging | 90% |
| E-commerce | Inventory consistency, payment idempotency, PII protection | 70% |
| SaaS | Multi-tenancy isolation, usage metering, SLA compliance | 70% |

---

## 12. Automation Workflows

End-to-end pipelines from ticket to deployed code.

**5 pipeline types:**
1. Feature pipeline: ticket --> explore --> propose --> spec --> design --> tasks --> apply --> verify
2. Bug fix pipeline: issue --> reproduce --> root-cause --> fix --> test --> verify
3. Migration pipeline: audit --> plan --> extract --> test --> route traffic --> decommission
4. Deploy pipeline: build --> test --> lint --> security scan --> deploy --> smoke test
5. New service pipeline: scaffold --> configure --> implement --> test --> dockerize --> integrate

---
