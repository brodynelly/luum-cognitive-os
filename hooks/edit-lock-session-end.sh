# edit-lock-session-end.sh — ADR-098 Phase C: release this session's edit locks on Stop.
#
# Registered as a Stop hook. Walks .cognitive-os/runtime/edit-locks/ and removes
# every lock owned by the current session_id, so leaks are bounded by session
# lifetime instead of the 30-min TTL.
#
# Idempotent and graceful: missing primitive → no-op exit 0, never blocks
# session cleanup.
