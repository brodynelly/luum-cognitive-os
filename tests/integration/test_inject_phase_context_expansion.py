        """[`adaptive-bypass`] marker in preamble is expanded to rule content.

        Strategy: create a minimal preamble that contains the marker, point the
        hook at it via PREAMBLE_FILE override (not a real env var the hook reads,
        so we inject the marker directly into the agent prompt and rely on the
        hook's inline CONTEXT_BUF construction + expansion pass).

        The hook already injects preamble content + phase rules and then calls
        expand() on CONTEXT_BUF.  We put a synthetic [`adaptive-bypass`] token
        in the agent prompt so the keyword-scan writes it into GOTCHAS or we
        confirm expansion happens through the preamble path.

        Simpler approach: write a temp preamble that contains [`adaptive-bypass`],
        export PREAMBLE_FILE env var... but the hook hard-codes the path as
        `$PROJECT_DIR/templates/agent-preamble.md`.  We therefore temporarily
        replace that file with our marker version using a tmp_path symlink trick
        OR we verify expansion works by calling ref_key_loader.expand() directly
        as a library test (still validates the hook's code path).
