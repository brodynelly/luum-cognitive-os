# Master Plan Checklist

> Living checklist for tracking execution of the durable product master plan.

## How To Use This Checklist

- Mark items complete only when there is evidence in code, docs, CI, demos, or tests.
- Prefer linking real artifacts when a checkbox is completed.
- Treat unchecked items as product work, not just documentation wishes.

## 1. Product Promise

- [x] The README expresses the same core product promise as the master plan.
- [x] CONTRIBUTING is aligned with the product-core narrative instead of subsystem sprawl.
- [x] The product promise is documented in [Durable Product Master Plan](durable-product-master-plan.md).
- [x] The product promise is documented in [Master Plan Execution Requirements](master-plan-execution-requirements.md).
- [x] Product positioning is documented in [Product Messaging](product-messaging.md).

## 2. Protected Core

- [x] A machine-readable kernel contract exists in [manifests/kernel-contract.yaml](../../manifests/kernel-contract.yaml).
- [x] Kernel scope is documented in [Kernel Contract](../kernel-contract.md).
- [x] Kernel contract tests exist.
- [x] The skills/rules portability gap is documented in [Skills and Rules Portability Gap](../architecture/skills-rules-portability-gap.md).
- [x] The canonicalization risk of moving skills/rules out of `.claude/` is documented in [Skills and Rules Canonicalization Risk Analysis](../architecture/skills-rules-canonicalization-risk-analysis.md).
- [x] A step-by-step migration plan exists in [Skills and Rules Canonicalization Workplan](../../.cognitive-os/plans/architecture/skills-rules-canonicalization-workplan.md).
- [x] Status and diagnostic tooling can read canonical-first artifact surfaces without changing install destinations.
- [x] Core versus compatibility versus extension versus experimental taxonomy is documented in [Product Zones](../product-zones.md).
- [x] New runtime additions are consistently classified by zone through root guardrails in [Product Zones Manifest](../../manifests/product-zones.yaml).
- [x] Central runtime paths avoid hardcoding non-core subsystems by default through [Runtime Hardcoding Discipline](../architecture/runtime-hardcoding-discipline.md) and `tests/contracts/test_runtime_hardcoding.py`.

## 3. Capability-Centric Enforcement

- [x] Capability profiles exist in the runtime.
- [x] Model routing uses capability-centric execution profiles before model choice.
- [x] Compatibility inventory explicitly distinguishes implemented and documented surfaces.
- [x] Dispatch uses capability-centric execution paths.
- [x] Gateway selection is capability-centric before vendor-centric.
- [x] Skill routing is capability-centric before vendor-centric.
- [x] Execution records and metrics include execution-profile data, not only model branding.
- [x] Direct Anthropic API usage is separated from Claude Code native account execution through [Direct Anthropic API Policy](../architecture/direct-anthropic-api-policy.md) and centralized runtime tests.
- [x] Advisor MCP is classified as optional external-advisor transport, not the canonical native advisor primitive, through [Advisor MCP Architecture Review](../architecture/advisor-mcp-architecture-review.md).

## 4. CI and Validation Integrity

- [x] Default CI covers representative Python product tests.
- [x] Default CI covers Go kernel and provider tests.
- [x] Default CI covers representative contract tests.
- [x] Default CI covers key behavior tests.
- [x] Default CI includes documentation integrity checks.
- [x] Release-plumbing checks can reason about canonical-first skill surfaces without changing install destinations.
- [x] Release-plumbing checks can validate the active settings driver instead of assuming `.claude/settings.json` is the only settings surface.
- [x] Audit and wiring validation can read the active settings driver instead of assuming `.claude/settings.json` is the only runtime surface.
- [x] CLI health and hook reporting can read the active settings driver instead of assuming `.claude/settings.json` is the only user-facing runtime surface.
- [x] Transparency/status reporting can read the active settings driver instead of assuming `.claude/settings.json` is the only hook-wiring surface.
- [x] Uninstall paths clean the active settings driver instead of assuming `.claude/settings.json` is the only hook-registration surface.
- [x] Secondary user-facing scripts use canonical project-root precedence when reading runtime state.
- [x] Update and auto-update paths preserve the active harness/settings driver instead of silently assuming Claude.
- [x] Git-triggered `post-merge` and `pre-push` auto-update paths preserve Codex-first installations through install metadata, even when `.claude/` compatibility markers are present.
- [x] Driver-specific user-facing scripts are explicitly classified so Claude-only registration/profile flows do not masquerade as Codex support.
- [x] Broken product-facing links fail visibly in automation.
- [x] Product claims in README and pitch map to explicit verification paths through [Product Proof Paths](../manual-tests/proof-paths.md).
- [x] Structural tests that support product claims are being converted into behavioral contracts through [Behavioral Test Contracts](../architecture/behavioral-test-contracts.md) and `tests/contracts/test_canonical_projection_behavior.py`.
- [x] Slow full-suite repair runs leave persistent summaries and actionable inventories through `scripts/pytest-with-summary.sh`, `scripts/test_run_inventory.py`, and [Testing Guide](../testing.md).
- [x] Test resource policy has a first manifest in `.cognitive-os/test-resource-policy.yaml`, with dry-run visibility and audit coverage for lane/resource alignment.
- [x] Test resource policy enforces timeout and explicit opt-in gates for cost-bearing and docker-required lanes in `cos-test`.
- [x] Test runs persist resource-policy metadata and outcome classification in
  `resource-policy.json`, including functional failures, policy blocks, and
  timeout exhaustion.
- [x] Local and CI test defaults are explicit: fast focused, broad non-Docker,
  Docker/e2e opt-in, and cost-bearing optional lanes have separate commands.
- [x] Slow live integration is explicit rather than part of the default
  non-Docker broad lane.
- [x] SessionStart performs a cached host-tool doctor check through `hooks/host-tool-doctor.sh`, while keeping broad pytest inventory explicit to avoid startup overload.
- [x] Primitive-coverage backend candidates have a documented local benchmark and unit-tested harness in [Primitive Coverage Backend Benchmark Research](../architecture/primitive-coverage-backend-benchmark-2026-05.md), so future graph/index integrations must prove license, offline, JSON/SARIF, stale-doc, and primitive-semantic fit before adoption.
- [x] Hook-enforced rule exclusions are contract-tested through [ADR-144](../adrs/ADR-144-hook-enforced-rule-projection-contract.md), `tests/audit/test_hook_enforced_exclusions.py`, and the projection drivers, so startup context diet cannot silently remove enforcement.
- [x] ADR-137 through ADR-144 have an implementation-status review in [ADR-137+ Implementation Review — 2026-05-04](../reports/adr-137-plus-implementation-review-2026-05-04.md), separating accepted cloud-flow premises from executable gates and naming the remaining local/web research.

## 5. Onboarding and Operational Simplicity

- [x] First-run installation is one-pass and low-friction through [First-Run Onboarding Proof](../manual-tests/first-run-onboarding.md).
- [x] Autodetection reduces required configuration for new users through shared harness detection and Codex-driver bootstrap coverage in `tests/integration/test_project_settings_generation.py`.
- [x] Settings projection supports more than one harness target in bootstrap paths.
- [x] Codex settings projection uses native `.codex/hooks.json` lifecycle keys
  instead of preserving Claude's `hooks` wrapper as a hidden compatibility crutch.
- [x] CLI runtime reads canonical skill/rule artifacts when the Claude projection is absent.
- [x] Upgrade paths preserve the active harness instead of silently falling back to Claude-first settings projection.
- [x] Emergency-stop keeps the core safety path cross-harness while marking Claude-only profile projection honestly.
- [x] Skills and rules use canonical-first discovery instead of depending on `.claude/` as the primary surface.
- [x] Codex-first projects get automatic advisory detection for active driver, dependency manifest, and Engram/MCP host wiring without requiring users to know the deep verification command.
- [x] Harness driver parity is now audited through `manifests/harness-driver-capabilities.yaml` and `scripts/harness_parity_audit.py`, so supported Codex gaps fail while limited/unsupported hook surfaces remain visible roadmap work.
- [x] Codex and Claude sessions now auto-load the portable memory lifecycle on
  supported events, with tests proving Codex can write session learning and
  resume tasks without `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`.
- [x] The host doctor now includes a synthetic memory lifecycle check, proving
  that a new Codex session can start Engram, recover pending work, capture
  prompt/session state, write git context, write a changelog, and emit the
  compaction memory-save reminder.
- [x] A portable session backlog reconciler (`scripts/cos_session_backlog.py`) now
  consolidates active tasks, plans, request queues, changelogs, handoffs, ADR
  implementation status, git, and optional Engram memory into
  `.cognitive-os/sessions/{session_id}/backlog.md`,
  `.cognitive-os/metrics/backlog-reconciliation.jsonl`,
  `.cognitive-os/metrics/adr-implementation-latest.json`, and `session/backlog/latest`.
- [x] Agentic primitive classification is now contract-enforced through
  `tests/contracts/test_primitive_scope_classification.py`: new skills, hooks,
  templates, and skill-referenced scripts must declare scope/audience/platform
  metadata and remain covered by product-zone guardrails and install-scope proof.
- [x] Conversation-to-primitive promotion is now advisory and tested through `scripts/cos_primitive_harvester.py`, `skills/primitive-harvester/SKILL.md`, and ADR-120: repeatable recipes can become primitive proposals, existing primitives are reused/improved, docs-only decisions stay docs-only, and low-signal conversations are discarded.
- [x] Developer-confidence positioning is documented as a lightweight adoption
  path: memory, doctor, minimal hooks, safety, changelog/session learning, and
  checks only where they provide clear value.
- [x] Harness transparency status is documented honestly: memory protection and fallback persistence work today across Claude Code and Codex, while ADR-064 Surfaces 2–4 remain the path to full cross-harness transparency.
- [x] Codex has a governed fallback layer for non-native Agent and Edit/Write hook chains through `scripts/cos_governed_runner.py` plus the Codex wrapper `scripts/cos_codex_guard.py`, so portability gaps are explicit rather than silently accepted.
- [x] Harness engineering is now documented and protected through [Harness Engineering](../architecture/harness-engineering.md), `manifests/harness-profiles.yaml`, `cos init-check`, `cos doctor harness`, `cos measure harness-profiles`, and `cos sprint run --dispatch`.
- [x] User-facing setup messages are clear and product-grade.
- [x] `hooks/self-install.sh` meets its performance expectations.
- [x] Setup and onboarding flows have visible performance budgets and regression tests through `scripts/demo-first-run-onboarding.sh` and `tests/integration/test_first_run_onboarding.py`.
- [x] A non-expert can reach a working baseline without reading deep architecture docs through [First-Run Onboarding Proof](../manual-tests/first-run-onboarding.md).

## 6. Complexity Compression

- [x] The repo is explicitly classified into core, compatibility, extensions, and experimental zones through [manifests/product-zones.yaml](../../manifests/product-zones.yaml).
- [x] Major docs present non-core systems as optional or secondary through [README](../../README.md), [Docs Index](../README.md), and [Product Zones](../product-zones.md).
- [x] Dashboard-heavy messaging is de-emphasized in top-level product docs.
- [x] Squad and organization-heavy messaging is de-emphasized in top-level product docs.
- [x] Experimental subsystems that compete with the wedge are archived, frozen, or clearly demoted through the product-zone taxonomy and top-level docs.
- [x] A feature reality audit exists to classify core, optional, and overextended surfaces.
- [x] External infrastructure is evaluated through a lightweight/default versus optional/reference decision frame in [Tooling Stack Rationalization](../architecture/tooling-stack-rationalization.md).
- [x] Docker, Python, cloud, and reference services are cataloged in [Infrastructure Service Catalog](../architecture/infrastructure-service-catalog.md).
- [x] Local connected-system validation is documented in [Local Connected Systems Validation](../manual-tests/local-connected-systems-validation.md), including dependency manifest checks, setup profiles, MCP wiring, optional-service boundaries, and persistent test summaries.
- [x] Observability backends are evaluated through a backend-neutral event-contract decision in [Observability Backend Evaluation](../architecture/observability-backend-evaluation-2026-04-24.md).

## 7. Visible Proof

- [x] Provider compatibility is explicitly inventoried.
- [x] Provider-agnostic outcome metrics exist.
- [x] A canonical demo shows provider and harness switching without system rewrites through [Five-Minute Demo](../manual-tests/five-minute-demo.md) and `scripts/demo-portability-proof.sh`.
- [x] A canonical demo shows real quality gates in action through [Five-Minute Demo](../manual-tests/five-minute-demo.md).
- [x] A canonical demo shows the core becoming usable in minutes through [Five-Minute Demo](../manual-tests/five-minute-demo.md).
- [x] The repo contains a short proof path for “easy to adopt, serious to trust” through [Product Proof Paths](../manual-tests/proof-paths.md).
- [x] The repo contains a short proof path for resilience under ecosystem churn through [Product Proof Paths](../manual-tests/proof-paths.md).

## 8. Immediate Known Gaps

- [x] Fix `README.md` reference to missing `docs/benchmark-results.md`.
- [x] Fix `CONTRIBUTING.md` references from `tests/run-all-tests.sh` to `scripts/run-all-tests.sh`.
- [x] Redesign `.github/workflows/ci.yml` around the real product core.
- [x] Triage and improve `hooks/self-install.sh` performance against behavior-test expectations.
- [x] Publish a simple “core vs extension” taxonomy document or section.
- [x] Prepare a canonical five-minute product demo path through [Five-Minute Demo](../manual-tests/five-minute-demo.md).
- [ ] Reduce the full Python suite from 195 failures to zero; current evidence is tracked in [Full Suite Validation Report](../reports/full-suite-validation-2026-04-23.md).

- [x] ADR-110 defines preserve branch governance in [ADR-110](../adrs/ADR-110-preserve-branch-governance.md).
- [x] Preserve branch lifecycle and consumer projection are documented in [Preserve Branch Lifecycle](../architecture/preserve-branch-lifecycle.md).
- [x] `scripts/cos-doctor-preserve.sh --json` detects missing manifests, mixed scope, integrated branches, non-ancestor tips, and delete candidates.
- [x] Preserve governance behavior tests cover the required scenarios in `tests/behavior/test_cos_doctor_preserve.py`.
- [ ] Existing local `codex/preserve-*` branches have manifests or are explicitly reconciled/deleted.
