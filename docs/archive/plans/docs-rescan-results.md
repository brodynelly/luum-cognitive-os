RECONCILIATION STATUS: STALE
Reconciled: 2026-04-21
Reason: point-in-time scan output from 2026-04-11. The 8 pointer-trimmed conversions shipped in ws5 (commit a8c6c58); remaining 9 SKILL-CANDIDATE conversions are parked — tracked implicitly under the docs-to-skills-audit plan, not here.
Recommendation: archive; the live tracker for residual conversions is in skill-atomicity-audit + docs-to-skills-audit.

## SKILL-CANDIDATE (action needed)

Docs with numbered/procedural steps that should be converted to skills.

| Doc | Proposed Skill | Size (chars) | ~Tokens |
|---|---|---|---|
| `docs/agent-teams-testing.md` | `test-agent-teams` (already exists — pointer needed) | 7,074 | 1,769 |
| `docs/benchmarking.md` | `run-benchmark` (already exists — pointer needed) | 4,893 | 1,223 |
| `docs/getting-started.md` | `cos-setup` (already exists — pointer needed) | 18,351 | 4,588 |
| `docs/getting-started-quick.md` | `cos-quickstart` (already exists — pointer needed) | 2,631 | 658 |
| `docs/quickstart.md` | `cos-quickstart` (duplicate of getting-started-quick.md) | 1,410 | 353 |
| `docs/testing-cognitive-os-suite.md` | `cognitive-os-test` (already exists) | 6,847 | 1,712 |
| `docs/testing-cognitive-os.md` | new skill: `cos-testing-guide` | 11,287 | 2,822 |
| `docs/self-repair-guide.md` | `self-improve` (partially exists) or new `repair-guide` | 14,840 | 3,710 |
| `docs/state-snapshots.md` | `devbox-checkpoint` (already exists — pointer needed) | 1,916 | 479 |

> **Note**: 7 of these 9 already have matching skills. They need pointer stubs, not new skills.
> True new skill candidates: `testing-cognitive-os.md` → `cos-testing-guide`, `self-repair-guide.md` → `repair-guide`

---

## SKILL-EXISTS (needs pointer trim)

Docs whose skill exists but the doc hasn't been trimmed to a pointer yet.

| Doc | Existing Skill | Size (chars) | ~Tokens |
|---|---|---|---|
| `docs/agent-teams-testing.md` | `test-agent-teams` | 7,074 | 1,769 |
| `docs/benchmarking.md` | `run-benchmark` | 4,893 | 1,223 |
| `docs/getting-started.md` | `cos-setup` / `cos-install` | 18,351 | 4,588 |
| `docs/getting-started-quick.md` | `cos-quickstart` | 2,631 | 658 |
| `docs/quickstart.md` | `cos-quickstart` | 1,410 | 353 |
| `docs/testing-cognitive-os-suite.md` | `cognitive-os-test` | 6,847 | 1,712 |
| `docs/state-snapshots.md` | `devbox-checkpoint` | 1,916 | 479 |
| `docs/hook-security-profiles.md` | `switch-security-profile` | 23,519 | 5,880 |
| `docs/self-building-protocol.md` | `self-improve` (partial) | 15,629 | 3,907 |

**Total token savings from pointer conversion**: ~20,569 tokens (~20K)

---

## POINTER-DONE (already converted)

Docs already trimmed to pointer stubs (contain "converted to an on-demand skill").

| Doc | Points to |
|---|---|
| `docs/auto-library.md` | `/recommend-library` |
| `docs/automation-doc-sync.md` | `/doc-sync` |
| `docs/capability-snapshot.md` | `/capability-snapshot` |
| `docs/competitive-arena.md` | `/arena` |
| `docs/definition-of-done.md` | `/dod-check` |
| `docs/gpu-sandbox.md` | `/gpu-sandbox` |
| `docs/health-monitoring.md` | `/cognitive-os-status` |
| `docs/plan-system.md` | `/plan-feature` |

---

## OBSOLETE (delete/archive)

| Doc | Reason |
|---|---|
| `docs/archived/benchmark-results.md` | Explicitly archived, point-in-time artifact from 2026-03-23, outdated |
| `docs/archived/cleanup-verification.md` | Explicitly archived, one-time verification report from 2026-03-22, complete |
| `docs/quickstart.md` | Duplicate of `docs/getting-started-quick.md`; both cover same install steps |
| `docs/launch-strategy.md` | Checklist-style (Phase 0-1), largely stale; action items are done or irrelevant |
| `docs/rules-consolidation-plan.md` | Implementation plan doc (35K chars); consolidation has likely been done; verify and archive |
| `docs/self-usage-audit.md` | Point-in-time audit from 2026-03-29; numbers stale (106 skills listed, many more exist now) |

---

## Action Priority

### High priority (convert to pointers — frees significant context)
1. `docs/hook-security-profiles.md` → pointer to `switch-security-profile` (~5,880 tokens)
2. `docs/getting-started.md` → pointer to `cos-setup` / `cos-install` (~4,588 tokens)
3. `docs/self-building-protocol.md` → pointer to `self-improve` (~3,907 tokens)
4. `docs/testing-cognitive-os-suite.md` → pointer to `cognitive-os-test` (~1,712 tokens)
5. `docs/agent-teams-testing.md` → pointer to `test-agent-teams` (~1,769 tokens)

### Low-hanging fruit (small docs, quick pointers)
6. `docs/benchmarking.md` → pointer to `run-benchmark`
7. `docs/getting-started-quick.md` → pointer to `cos-quickstart`
8. `docs/state-snapshots.md` → pointer to `devbox-checkpoint`

### New skills to create
9. `docs/testing-cognitive-os.md` → create skill `cos-testing-guide`
10. `docs/self-repair-guide.md` → create skill `repair-guide`

### Delete/archive
11. `docs/archived/` contents → already archived subdirectory, safe to keep
12. `docs/quickstart.md` → delete (duplicate of getting-started-quick.md)
13. `docs/launch-strategy.md` → archive (stale action items)
14. `docs/rules-consolidation-plan.md` → verify done, then archive
15. `docs/self-usage-audit.md` → archive (stale point-in-time)
