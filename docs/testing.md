# Test Suite Documentation

## Overview

The luum-agent-os test suite contains **~5639 tests** across **195 test files**, organized into four categories: unit, behavior, integration, and system. Tests are executed via pytest and surfaced through a Go-based TUI dashboard (`cos-test`).

## Architecture

```
cos-test (Go: Cobra + Bubbletea + Lipgloss)
  └── ./run -m pytest --json-report
        └── tests/
              ├── unit/          (94 files, ~2823 tests)
              ├── behavior/      (73 files, ~1636 tests)
              ├── integration/   (17 files, ~259 tests)
              ├── system/        (5 files, 25 tests)
              └── conftest.py + pytest.ini
```

- **cos-test** is a Go binary (`cmd/cos-test/`) built with Cobra (CLI), Bubbletea (TUI), and Lipgloss (styling). It wraps pytest with `--json-report` and renders results in a terminal dashboard.
- **conftest.py** provides shared fixtures, markers, and test configuration.
- **pytest.ini** defines marker registrations and default options.

### Integration Tests (~259 tests, 17 files)

Require Docker. Use testcontainers to spin up **17 Docker services** on demand. Marked with the `docker` pytest marker.

| File | Tests | Services |
|------|-------|----------|
| `test_databases.py` | Database connectivity | Postgres (x2), MySQL, Valkey, ClickHouse |
| `test_app_services.py` | Application services | Langfuse web + worker, LiteLLM, Jupyter, Opik backend |
| `test_platform_services.py` | Platform services | Paperclip, MemU, Cognee, SeaweedFS, Automaker, NeMo, Opik frontend |
| `test_eval_frameworks.py` | Eval frameworks | DeepEval + RAGAS import and API validation |
| `test_e2e_flows.py` | End-to-end flows | 5 multi-service flows using `testcontainers` for isolated observability/memory/reference stacks |
| `test_service_health.py` | Service health | Compose contract + opt-in localhost probes for reference stacks; does not start optional services |
| `test_repair_chain.py` | Repair chain | Error learning and dispatch across services |
| `test_metrics_rotation.py` | Metrics rotation | Truncation and archiving pipelines |
| `test_opik_integration.py` | Opik SDK | Opik SDK validation against running service |
| `test_cognee_integration.py` | Cognee SDK | Cognee SDK validation against running service |

`test_service_health.py` is intentionally lighter than the `testcontainers`
lanes. It verifies that reference stacks such as Opik and Cognee remain modeled
correctly in `docker-compose.cognitive-os.yml` and in `cognitive-os.yaml`, but
it does not imply they are part of the default local product path. If a test
needs to prove those stacks actually boot and serve traffic in isolation, prefer
the `testcontainers` integration lanes instead of turning default-lane smoke
tests into implicit Docker bring-up.

### System Tests (25 tests, 5 files)

Validate configuration files, container state, and runtime consistency.

| File | Tests | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `test_config.py` | Configuration | `cognitive-os.yaml` schema and value validation |
| `test_docker.py` | Containers | Running container status checks |
| `test_docker_stack.py` | Docker stack | Compose file validity and image availability |
| `test_metrics.py` | Metrics | JSONL file validity and schema conformance |
| `test_rules.py` | Rules | Rule file consistency and required fields |

## Running Tests

### Persistent Local Run Artifacts

Use `scripts/pytest-with-summary.sh` for any repair-oriented partial or full
test run. It preserves the full output, a short summary, failure snippets,
JUnit XML, metadata, and the exit code under
`.cognitive-os/reports/test-runs/`, which is ignored by git.

```bash
bash scripts/pytest-with-summary.sh -- tests/unit/test_example.py -q -ra
bash scripts/pytest-with-summary.sh -- tests/ -q --tb=short
```

While the repair effort is still separating core behavior from optional
reference stacks, prefer a broad non-Docker lane before running the full suite:

```bash
bash scripts/pytest-with-summary.sh -- tests/ -m 'not docker' -q --tb=short -ra --disable-warnings --timeout=120 --timeout-method=thread --session-timeout=900 --maxfail=40
```

This lane is still intentionally broad and can be slow, but it should not start
testcontainers stacks. Use its `inventory.md` as the next repair queue instead
of rerunning `tests/` just to recover the failure list.

The latest run is linked at `.cognitive-os/reports/test-runs/latest`.
Prefer this wrapper while reducing broad-suite failures so interrupted or
partial runs remain analyzable across sessions.

Each run also gets a test inventory:

- `inventory.md` — human-readable repair queue, skipped/xfail/failure list,
  slowest tests, and heuristic tags such as `optional-lane`, `drift`,
  `aspirational`, `timeout`, and `false-positive-risk`.
- `inventory.json` — machine-readable version for later dashboards, agents, or
  repair automation.

You can regenerate the inventory without rerunning pytest:

```bash
python3 scripts/test-run-inventory.py --run-dir .cognitive-os/reports/test-runs/latest
```

If pytest times out before writing JUnit XML, the inventory falls back to the
captured stack trace and records a synthetic timeout item. That keeps timeout
failures visible instead of turning them into empty reports.

This wrapper is part of the Cognitive OS development workflow. It is paired
with the OS-only `test-contract-repair` skill and should be used whenever
maintainers repair or classify this repository's own test suite. Projects that
install Cognitive OS should keep using their own test command, or a
project-facing testing skill, unless they explicitly opt into Cognitive OS
maintainer tooling.

### Without Docker (unit + behavior + system)

```bash
./run -m pytest tests/unit/ tests/behavior/ tests/system/ -v
```

### With Docker (integration + e2e)

```bash
./run -m pytest tests/ -v -m docker
```

Some Docker lanes are optional reference stacks rather than default product
requirements. For example, `tests/integration/test_app_services.py` starts
heavy application services with testcontainers and only runs when explicitly
requested:

```bash
COS_RUN_OPTIONAL_APP_SERVICES=1 bash scripts/pytest-with-summary.sh -- tests/integration/test_app_services.py -q -ra
```

The heavier multi-service E2E reference flows are also opt-in:

```bash
COS_RUN_E2E_REFERENCE_FLOWS=1 bash scripts/pytest-with-summary.sh -- tests/integration/test_e2e_flows.py -q -ra
```

Other testcontainers lanes are also explicit opt-ins:

```bash
COS_RUN_DATABASE_CONTAINERS=1 bash scripts/pytest-with-summary.sh -- tests/integration/test_databases.py -q -ra
COS_RUN_PLATFORM_SERVICES=1 bash scripts/pytest-with-summary.sh -- tests/integration/test_platform_services.py -q -ra
COS_RUN_OPIK_REFERENCE=1 bash scripts/pytest-with-summary.sh -- tests/integration/test-opik-integration.py -q -ra
COS_RUN_COGNEE_REFERENCE=1 bash scripts/pytest-with-summary.sh -- tests/integration/test-cognee-integration.py -q -ra
COS_RUN_SMART_INFRA_CONTAINERS=1 bash scripts/pytest-with-summary.sh -- tests/integration/test_smart_infra_containers.py -q -ra
```

`tests/contracts/test_optional_docker_lanes.py` enforces this policy so any new
integration test that creates testcontainers must declare and document a
`COS_RUN_*` opt-in flag before it can enter the repository.

## Coverage

| Category | Files | Tests | Percentage |
|----------|-------|-------|------------|
| Unit | 94 | ~2823 | ~50% |
| Behavior | 73 | ~1636 | ~29% |
| Integration | 17 | ~259 | ~5% |
| System | 5 | 25 | <1% |
| **Total** | **195** | **~5639** | **100%** |

The unit test layer now carries the plurality of coverage. Behavior tests shifted focus from file-existence checks (reclassified as unit) to pure behavioral assertions — 65% of behavior tests verify runtime behavior, 3% are integration-style, and the remainder validate structural invariants. This keeps the feedback loop fast while ensuring real behavior is covered.

## Key Fixtures (conftest.py)

Four shared fixtures power the behavioral and unit layers:

| Fixture | What It Provides |
|---------|-----------------|
| `real_engram` | A real engram client backed by a temp SQLite DB — no MagicMock |
| `isolated_cos_home` | Temporary `COS_HOME` directory via `tmp_path` + monkeypatch |
| `override_settings` | Monkeypatches `cognitive-os.yaml` values without touching disk |
| `run_hook` | Executes a hook script with mock stdin JSON, captures stdout/stderr/exit code |

## Adding New Tests

### 1. Choose the right category

- **Unit** (`tests/unit/`): Pure functions, state machines, parsers. No I/O, no Docker.
- **Behavior** (`tests/behavior/`): Hook contracts, skill validation, protocol logic. May read files but no external services.
- **Integration** (`tests/integration/`): Requires Docker services. Use testcontainers or the `docker` marker.
- **System** (`tests/system/`): Config validation, container checks, file consistency.

### 2. File naming

All test files must follow the pattern `test_*.py` and live in the appropriate category directory.

### 3. Test structure

```python
"""Tests for <component>."""
import pytest

class TestComponentName:
    """<Component> behavior tests."""

    def test_specific_behavior(self):
        """Should <expected behavior>."""
        # Arrange
        ...
        # Act
        ...
        # Assert
        assert result == expected

    @pytest.mark.parametrize("input,expected", [...])
    def test_parameterized(self, input, expected):
        """Should handle <varied inputs>."""
        assert function(input) == expected
```

### 4. Markers

Use pytest markers to classify tests that need special handling:

```python
@pytest.mark.docker       # Requires Docker (integration tests)
@pytest.mark.slow         # Long-running test
```

### 5. Fixtures

Shared fixtures live in `conftest.py`. Category-specific fixtures can go in a local `conftest.py` within the category directory.

### 6. Integration test pattern (testcontainers)

```python
@pytest.mark.docker
class TestServiceIntegration:
    def test_service_responds(self, service_container):
        """Service should respond to health check."""
        response = requests.get(f"http://localhost:{service_container.port}/health")
        assert response.status_code == 200
```

## CI/CD Integration

The test suite integrates into CI/CD pipelines through pytest's JSON report output:

```bash
./run -m pytest tests/ --json-report --json-report-file=report.json
```

The `cos-test` TUI consumes this report format. CI pipelines can:

1. Run the non-Docker suite (unit + behavior + system) on every push.
2. Run the full suite including integration tests on PR merges or scheduled builds (requires Docker).
3. Parse `report.json` for pass/fail counts and failure details.

Recommended CI stages:

| Stage | Command | When |
|-------|---------|------|
| Fast check | `./run -m pytest tests/unit/ tests/behavior/ -v` | Every push |
| System check | `./run -m pytest tests/system/ -v` | Every push |
| Integration | `./run -m pytest tests/ -v -m docker` | PR merge, nightly |
