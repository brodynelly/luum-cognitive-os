# SDD cos-native-goal-loop Follow-up Audit — CATALOG-COMPACT edit in 07572f1e

## Context

During the S1 review of the `cos-native-goal-loop` SDD cycle, commit `07572f1e`
("docs: complete cos-native-goal-loop SDD ready for archive") was identified as
including an unrelated edit to `skills/CATALOG-COMPACT.md`. The commit message
correctly listed the CATALOG-COMPACT.md change in its body, so the modification
was not hidden, but it represents a cross-concern inclusion inside a
goal-loop-scoped SDD commit.

The original instruction referenced commit `44513883` as the source of the
smuggled edit. Investigation reveals that `44513883` (`chore: regenerate
goal-loop side artifacts`) did NOT touch CATALOG-COMPACT.md. The actual change
is in its predecessor `07572f1e`. This audit report documents the finding under
the originally referenced review ID (`21036`) for traceability.

## Decision

**Kept — no revert.**

The content changes are correct and desirable:

- Total skills count corrected from 178 to 177 (accurate count after the
  goal-loop cycle removed `optimize-skill` Spanish-language version).
- `both (39)` → `both (38)`: accurate section count.
- Skill description updates (`product-answer`, `impact-analysis`,
  `optimize-skill`) are English translations / clarifications that were already
  part of the prior English-only audit cleanup chain.

Reverting would re-introduce stale/incorrect catalog counts and a
Spanish-language skill description, both of which would be immediately reflagged
by the English-only audit hook.
