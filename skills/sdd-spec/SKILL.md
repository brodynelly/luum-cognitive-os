# SDD Spec

## Purpose

Translate proposal context into requirements, non-goals, and executable acceptance criteria. When EAS is requested or the change is large/critical, create or update an EAS artifact from `templates/eas.md`.

## EAS Emission Rule

Emit EAS when any condition is true:

- the user asks for EAS, Executable Acceptance Specification, SDD Evidence Artifact, gap matrix, or detractor log;
- the change is large, critical, security-sensitive, migration-related, or cross-service;
- acceptance criteria need ATDD/TDD mapping;
- multiple documentation sources must be reconciled.

## Procedure

1. Gather proposal, exploration, existing docs, contracts, tests, and constraints.
2. Write requirements as stable `REQ-*` rows.
3. Write non-goals to bound scope.
4. Convert every requirement into at least one `AC-*` executable acceptance row with verification method and expected result.
5. Create the EAS artifact using `templates/eas.md` when the EAS emission rule applies.
6. Populate the initial gap matrix. Rows may start as uncovered only before implementation; do not mark an EAS complete while uncovered rows remain.
7. Add adversarial personas, including `Detractor`.
8. Add at least one substantive `OBJ-*` detractor objection and required evidence.
9. Add verification commands or manual checks that `sdd-verify` can execute or inspect.
10. Save the spec and EAS path in the phase output.

## Output Contract

Return:

```text
SDD_SPEC: <change-name>
Spec path: <path or Engram topic>
EAS path: <path or none with reason>
Requirements: <count>
Acceptance criteria: <count>
Open gaps: <count>
Detractor objections: <count>
Verification commands: <count>
```

## Handoff To sdd-tasks

If EAS exists, `sdd-tasks` must consume the EAS gap matrix and ATDD/TDD mapping. Include the EAS path in the handoff.
