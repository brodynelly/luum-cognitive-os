# Architecture Map Answer

## Purpose

Generate a compact, commercial-safe architecture map for Cognitive OS from the
ADR-313 `architecture_map` product-answer primitive.

Use this when the user wants to explain the SO's architecture externally or to a
commercial/product audience without exposing internal tool names, implementation
counts, provider names, or immature runtime claims.

## Fast path

From the SO repository root:

```bash
scripts/cos-product-answer --question-id architecture_map --format markdown
```

If the card is stale or missing:

```bash
scripts/cos-product-answer-refresh --question-id architecture_map
scripts/cos-product-answer --question-id architecture_map --format markdown
```

## Output discipline

- Keep the value-chain structure: team → coding agents → Cognitive OS →
  guardrails/policies/playbooks/memory/evidence → operational trust.
- Use generic labels such as "development tools" or "existing agent tools" in
  public/commercial mode.
- Do not lead with counts of hooks, rules, skills, scripts, manifests, or tests.
- Do not name internal providers, private tools, or immature service surfaces
  unless the user explicitly asks for technical due diligence.
- Keep Mermaid simple: prefer `graph TD` and single-line labels for broad
  renderer compatibility.
- Include unsafe claims and gaps when the answer is used for external copy.

## Adaptation rule

When the SO grows, update these evidence surfaces instead of rewriting chat copy:

1. `manifests/product-question-bank.yaml` — public wording and aliases.
2. `manifests/product-claim-evidence.yaml` — maturity, evidence, and boundaries.
3. Architecture/product docs referenced by the claim evidence.
4. Product-answer cards via `scripts/cos-product-answer-refresh`.

The public categories should stay stable unless product positioning changes.
Implementation details can move underneath those categories.

## Validation

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/behavior/test_product_answer_cli.py -q
scripts/cos-product-answer --question-id architecture_map --format markdown --no-cache
```
