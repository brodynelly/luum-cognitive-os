# ADR-144: Hook-Enforced Rule Projection Contract

## Status

Accepted. Hook-enforced rule exclusions are now a projection contract, not a prose convention.

## Context

Cognitive OS reduces startup/context load by excluding many full rule files from
agent context in `hooks/self-install.sh:EXCLUDED_RULES`. The intended contract is:

1. `RULES-COMPACT.md` keeps a compact reference to the rule;
2. the full rule body is not injected at session start;
3. a registered hook enforces the mechanical part of the rule.

A wiring audit found a dangerous fourth state: some rules were excluded as
"hook-enforced" while their hooks existed on disk but were not projected into
`.claude/settings.json`. This made the startup diet look successful while the
runtime enforcement was absent. Examples included scope proportionality,
scope-creep detection, token-budget monitoring, consequence evaluation,
auto-skill generation, assumption tracking, and prompt quality.

The project also has multiple projection layers:

- `cognitive-os.yaml > harness.hooks` is the canonical registry for portable
  harness projection;
- `scripts/_lib/settings-driver-claude-code.sh` generates `.claude/settings.json`;
- `scripts/_lib/settings-driver-codex.sh` generates `.codex/hooks.json` for the
  subset Codex can emit;
- `scripts/apply-efficiency-profile.sh` invokes the drivers;
- downstream installs use the same profile/projection machinery.

Therefore directly editing generated settings would fix only the self-hosted
checkout and would leave consumer projects vulnerable to the same drift.

## Decision

A rule may be listed in `EXCLUDED_RULES` with a `# → hook.sh` enforcement claim
only if all of the following are true:

1. every referenced hook file exists;
2. every referenced Claude/Codex-compatible hook is present in
   `cognitive-os.yaml > harness.hooks`;
3. the hook is projected by the active profile into the relevant harness settings;
4. if a rule is intentionally not hook-enforced, the comment must say
   `agent-instruction-only` or otherwise avoid a `# → hook.sh` claim.

We also add a PreToolUse Bash gate, `hooks/skill-router-bash-gate.sh`, for the
highest-ROI bypass class found during the audit: direct dependency/toolchain
upgrades. Direct upgrade commands such as `brew upgrade`, `pip install --upgrade`,
`uv sync --upgrade`, and equivalent package-manager upgrades must go through
`/deps-update` / `scripts/deps-update.sh` unless explicitly overridden with
`COS_ALLOW_SKILL_BYPASS=1`.

## Consequences

- Startup remains lean: rules can still be excluded from context when hooks are real.
- Missing hook projection now fails an audit test instead of relying on manual review.
- Self-hosted and consumer-project settings are fixed at the canonical projection
  layer, not by hand-editing generated settings files.
- Some additional maintainer hooks run in the hot path. This is accepted because
  the selected hooks are directly tied to rules already advertised as enforced.
- Codex receives only the supported Bash subset; non-Bash Agent/Edit/Write hooks
  remain represented in the canonical registry and Claude projection until Codex
  supports those events.

## Alternatives rejected

| Alternative | Rejected because |
|---|---|
| Register all 72 unregistered hooks | Too much latency/noise; violates the profile model. |
| Remove all listed rules from `EXCLUDED_RULES` | Restores context load and loses the startup diet benefit. |
| Patch only `.claude/settings.json` | Generated artifact drift; downstream projects remain broken. |
| Leave as manual discipline | This already failed; tests claimed coverage while exemptions hid the gap. |

## Verification

Automatic:

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/audit/test_hook_enforced_exclusions.py tests/behavior/test_skill_router_bash_gate.py -q
python3 -m pytest tests/behavior/test_self_install.py tests/integration/test_project_settings_generation.py -q
bash scripts/_lib/settings-driver-claude-code.sh --check
bash scripts/_lib/settings-driver-codex.sh --check
```
