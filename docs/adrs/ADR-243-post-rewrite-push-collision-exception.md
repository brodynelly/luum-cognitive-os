# ADR-243: Post-Rewrite Push-Collision Check Exception

## Status

Proposed. Drafted during the 2026-05-08 pre-public readiness session after
the push-collision-check repeatedly blocked legitimate post-rewrite force
pushes, driving the operator to `--no-verify`. Requires operator review
before implementation. Companion to ADR-242.

## Context

After a history rewrite (mailmap, sanitize, or text replacement), every
commit on the rewritten branch has the same subject line as before but a
new SHA. The push-collision-check primitive
(`hooks/_lib/push-collision-check.sh` plus
`scripts/push_collision_detect.py`) treats subject-identical commits with
divergent SHAs as a strong signal of accidental duplicate commits and
blocks the push.

This is correct in normal operation. After a deliberate rewrite, it is a
false positive, and a high-cost one: there can be hundreds of subject
collisions on a single rewrite, and there is no way to acknowledge them
in a single gesture.

Observed symptoms on 2026-05-08:

- Force-push after `cos-history-sanitization --execute` was blocked by
  push-collision-check on every rewritten commit.
- The documented bypass envs only worked when pre-set in the harness env;
  inline `DISABLE_HOOK_PUSH_COLLISION_CHECK=1 git push` did not reach the
  PreToolUse hook (the same root issue ADR-241 addresses).
- The operator fell back to `git push --no-verify --force-with-lease`,
  which discarded *every* push-time protection (commit signing checks,
  branch ownership lock, merge-queue gates), not only the collision check.
- No audit trail recorded that a rewrite had occurred, so a separate
  reviewer could not distinguish a benign post-rewrite force-push from
  a destructive one.

## Decision

Introduce a "post-rewrite mode" that the rewrite path writes and the
push-collision check reads.

1. **Write side.** `lib/history_sanitization.py` (and the wrapper from
   ADR-242) writes `.cognitive-os/runtime/last-rewrite.json` containing:
   - `pre_head` — the SHA of `HEAD` before the rewrite,
   - `post_head` — the SHA of `HEAD` after the rewrite,
   - `rewritten_at` — ISO-8601 timestamp,
   - `ttl_seconds` — default 86400 (24 hours),
   - `rules_hash` — the same hash ADR-242 records.
2. **Read side.** `hooks/_lib/push-collision-check.sh` and
   `scripts/push_collision_detect.py` consult this file before raising
   collisions. The post-rewrite exception applies if and only if all of:
   - the file exists and is within `ttl_seconds`,
   - the local `HEAD` SHA equals `post_head`,
   - the upstream `HEAD` SHA equals `pre_head` (i.e. the push is the
     expected first push of the rewrite),
   - the colliding commits are within the rewrite's commit range.
3. **Audit, do not silence.** When the exception applies, the check still
   logs every collision to `agent-heartbeat.jsonl` with the rewrite hash
   as correlation, so the audit trail is preserved. The hook returns
   success rather than failure.
4. **Marker lifecycle.** The marker is cleared on first successful push or
   when its TTL expires, whichever is sooner. A subsequent rewrite
   overwrites it.

## Alternatives rejected

- **Always allow force-push after a rewrite without an audit entry** —
  rejected because it removes the operator's ability to retrospectively
  see that subject-identical commits were intentional, not accidental.
- **Require the operator to pass `--allow-rewrite` on the push command** —
  rejected because most operators reach for `--no-verify` first; the goal
  is to remove the incentive to bypass *all* gates to avoid one.
- **Cache acknowledged collisions in Engram and ask interactively per
  commit** — rejected because rewrites can produce hundreds of collisions
  and an interactive loop is a worse UX than a documented marker file.
- **Disable push-collision-check entirely after any rewrite for the life
  of the branch** — rejected because the protection should re-engage as
  soon as the rewrite is upstream, which is what the marker TTL achieves.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Force-push after a deliberate rewrite no longer requires `--no-verify`,
  so the other push-time protections stay engaged.
- The audit trail still records the colliding commit set, with a
  correlation hash that links it to the rewrite that produced it.
- Reviewers can distinguish a post-rewrite push from a regression because
  the marker file is part of the recovery artifact set from ADR-242.

### Negative

- A 24-hour TTL is a window in which a non-rewrite force-push could match
  the marker conditions and be admitted; the conjunction
  (`pre_head` upstream + `post_head` local + commit range) makes this
  narrow but not impossible.
- One more file under `.cognitive-os/runtime/` to manage at session end.
- Two hooks (the bash and python paths) must stay in sync on the
  exception logic.

## Acceptance criteria

1. After `cos-history-sanitization --execute`,
   `.cognitive-os/runtime/last-rewrite.json` exists with all required
   fields and a future `expires_at`.
2. With the marker present and matching, `git push --force-with-lease`
   succeeds without `--no-verify` even when subject collisions exist.
3. Without the marker, push-collision-check still blocks on the same
   collisions.
4. After a successful push, the marker is cleared.
5. `tests/behavior/test_push_collision_post_rewrite.py` covers:
   marker-match success, marker-expired fallback, marker-mismatch
   fallback, audit-entry presence on success.

## Verification

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/behavior/test_push_collision_post_rewrite.py -q
test -f .cognitive-os/runtime/last-rewrite.json && \
  python3 -c "import json,sys; json.load(open('.cognitive-os/runtime/last-rewrite.json'))"
```
