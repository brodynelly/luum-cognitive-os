"""Enforcement test for ADR-087: ADR file location convention.

Every .md file matching the ADR naming pattern (ADR-[digits]*.md, case-insensitive)
must live in `docs/adrs/` — the single canonical root established by ADR-087.

Two explicit exemptions (per ADR-087 §"Canonical structure"):
  1. `docs/architecture/cos-dispatch/adrs/CD-*.md` — subsystem namespace with CD- prefix
  2. One-line redirect stubs (first line is `# Moved`) at old paths — migration artifacts
     governed by ADR-087, to be removed after one release cycle.

Violation = any file matching the ADR pattern found outside `docs/adrs/` that is
neither a cos-dispatch CD- file nor a one-line redirect stub.

This test EXECUTES the check (walks the filesystem) rather than relying on a
static fixture, satisfying the project's quality-gate requirement for audit tests.

#                                    to link task to its governing ADR.
#   .cognitive-os/plans/           — implementation plans (e.g. adr-049-050-051-mega-plan.md
#                                    is a sprint plan, not an ADR).
#   .cognitive-os/snapshots/       — pre-agent preservation copies. These may
#                                    contain historical docs/adrs files verbatim
#                                    and are not canonical ADR locations.
#   docs/reports/                  — audit/report artifacts that reference ADRs by number.
#   docs/architecture/harness-adoption-gap/adr-003-hook-registration-pending.md
#                                  — a pending-work note file, not the ADR itself (the
