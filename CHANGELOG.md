## [Unreleased]

### Added — ADR-176: SkillStore SQLite schema adoption + post-execution analysis trigger (2026-05-05)

ADR-176 adopts OpenSpace's 6-table SQLite schema verbatim (source: HKUDS/OpenSpace @ d1e367d, `skill_engine/store.py` lines 80–166) and introduces a discipline-gated post-execution analysis trigger. Key additions: `lib/skill_store.py` (SkillStore class; 6-table schema: `skill_records`, `skill_lineage_parents`, `execution_analyses`, `skill_judgments`, `skill_tool_deps`, `skill_tags`), `scripts/migrate_skill_archive_to_store.py` (idempotent migration from `skill-archive.jsonl`), and `hooks/skill-post-execution-analysis.sh` (PostToolUse Agent, async). Discipline gate (ADR-133/134) is structurally enforced: the hook's only write path to skill-related files is `docs/reports/skill-analysis-proposals/` — no code path to live `SKILL.md` exists.



### Added — Multi-surface UI architecture (ADR-172)

- `docs/adrs/ADR-172-multi-surface-ui-architecture.md` — accepted. Declares four UI surfaces: Surface 1 (operator CLI + markdown reports), Surface 2 (Phoenix LLM-trace UI, opt-in), Surface 3 (Engram Cloud), Surface 4 (Obsidian). CLI-as-primary from ADR-170 survives as Surface 1.
- `docs/reports/surface-5-tui-ui-candidates-2026-05-05.md` — audit report of TUI candidates as input to a future ADR-173.

### Changed — ADR-043 deprecated


### Changed — ADR-170 superseded

- `docs/adrs/ADR-170-operator-cli-as-primary-ui-surface.md` — marked Superseded by ADR-172. CLI-as-primary clause survives as Surface 1 inside ADR-172.


- Removed 6 hook entries from `cognitive-os.yaml` (SessionStart ×2, PostToolUse Agent ×3, Stop ×1)
- Removed 6 registrations from `scripts/_lib/settings-driver-claude-code.sh`
- Removed 6 entries from `hooks/_lib/registration-allowlist.txt`

## [0.26.0] - 2026-05-05 — "Operator-CLI Primary, Phoenix Optional, Honest API Findings"

This release pivots the UI surface story away from a single web dashboard
toward an honest operator-CLI plus markdown-reports model, with Phoenix
declared as an opt-in trace surface. Two days of audits and live verifications
documents that finding instead of papering over it, and reframes the system
around interfaces that actually work today.

### Changed — Operator-CLI as primary UI surface (ADR-170)

- Phoenix declared as a **complementary opt-in surface** for LLM traces only (`uv sync --extra observability && uv run phoenix serve`). It does not model COS lifecycle / doctrine / demotion / audit_class. CLI + markdown remains the governance surface.
- Falsifiable claim added in ADR-170: CLI usability for new operators (under 5-minute orientation), markdown report cadence (at least one per major decision cycle for 60 days), and external-buyer demand (no Shape B trigger from three independent UI-blocker citations within 6 months). Re-evaluation after one year.



### Changed — Mapping #5 deferred (cos packages → skills marketplace)


### Changed — Dashboard formally demoted (ADR-169)

- `dashboard/` formally archived. `dashboard/ARCHIVED.md` is the new entry point and points at ADR-169. Files preserved on disk (not deleted) so the demotion is reversible if the falsifiable claim in the ADR fires.

### Added — Docker worker accessibility

- `docs/runbooks/run-cos-in-docker.md` — operator runbook for the ADR-140 worker container. Quick Start (90 seconds), bootstrap subcommand reference, BYOK env vars per ADR-139, full stack with engram-cloud profile per ADR-141, audit-trail compliance evidence per ADR-142, troubleshooting, related-docs cross-reference. Closes the maintainer-cache discoverability gap surfaced when the runbook was missing despite the underlying infrastructure being complete.
- `scripts/cos-cloud-worker-bootstrap.sh` — added `up-full` subcommand that activates the engram-cloud Compose profile (postgres + pgvector + engram cloud server). `down` now stops both default and engram-cloud profiles so callers do not need to know which subset was started. Usage banner now lists every subcommand with one-line descriptions and points at the runbook.
- `README.md` — new "Headless / cloud-worker container" section in the Quick Start area, linking to the runbook. Differentiates the Docker worker (headless / CI / evaluation) from the daily-IDE-governance install path.
- `docs/INDEX.md` — added entry for the runbook under Operational Documents.
- `docs/getting-started.md` — new "Headless deployment via Docker" section before "Next Steps", with a decision matrix (which path for which scenario).

## [0.25.0] - 2026-05-05 — "Embedded-Runtime Trajectory and Enterprise-Readiness"

This release commits the operational direction for Cognitive OS to shift from
*"governance layer over coding agents"* toward *"embedded runtime for agent
flows"* (ADR-137), and lands the enterprise-readiness surface (BYOK
credentials, cross-OS containers, engram-cloud replication, air-gapped audit
trail) that makes the trajectory consumable outside the maintainer's machine.

158 commits since v0.24.0, 13+ new ADRs (137–149, 168), 15+ new architecture
documents, 10+ new lib modules. The doctrine deepens with the *"Two maturity
stages"* extension to `cognitive-prosthesis.md` — a primitive earns
default-visible status only when both *does it work?* and *how would I know
mechanically when it stops working?* are answered.

### Added — Closure Discipline Gate (ADR-143)

- `docs/adrs/ADR-143-closure-discipline-gate.md` — accepted blocking maintainer gate for closing validator drift after fast agent batches.
- `scripts/cos-closure-discipline-audit` / `scripts/cos_closure_discipline_audit.py` — quick structural audit for stale suspended-workflow references, hardcoded runtime hook counts, validation capsule minimal-repo fallback, primitive lifecycle findings, and local-CI self-wiring.
- `docs/manual-tests/closure-discipline.md` and `tests/unit/test_closure_discipline_audit.py` — manual and automatic proof paths for closure discipline.

### Fixed — Validation closure drift from May 3 batch

- Updated workflow tests to understand ADR-130 `.yml.disabled` preservation.
- Replaced hardcoded runtime hook count assertion with report-derived runtime-hook reality parity.
- Made `cos-validation-capsule.sh` usable in minimal repos without silently falling back to `rm -rf`.
- Updated work-inventory tests to opt out of ephemeral-path filtering when testing direct parser behavior.
- Corrected blocking primitive lifecycle metadata for self-improvement discipline and registry-lock gates.

### Documentation

- `docs/architecture/cognitive-prosthesis.md` — new section *Two maturity stages: works-when-it-works, and knows-when-it-doesn't* enumerates the nine concrete mechanisms that materialise the transition (demotion-with-evidence, governance-maturity labels, silent-failure allowlist, aspirational audit, false-positive ledger, propose-only proposers per ADR-134/135, anti-self-validation, ADR-136 runway with observable triggers, falsifiable claims as release artefact). Adds the operable test for whether a capability belongs in the default profile: not only *does it work?* but *how would I know mechanically when it stops working?*.
- `docs/architecture/dx-cloud-flow-bootstrap-plan.md` — new strategic plan for COS as runtime-of-prosthesis for cloud agent flows (vuln-fix, bug-fix, features, docs, primitive expansion) under human audit. Names the trajectory B → A (governance layer over agents → embedded runtime), the priority shifts that follow, and the bootstrap path: vulnerability remediation in `e2b` sandbox as flow #1 with explicit budget caps (zero new default-visible primitives, zero rules added to RULES-COMPACT, no Shape B activation). Includes 6 falsifiable conditions, 5 explicit non-goals, and a 3-step ordered next-action list.
- `docs/adrs/ADR-137-operational-trajectory-governance-layer-to-embedded-runtime.md` — accepted trajectory ADR. Commits direction `Framing B → Framing A` orthogonal to ADR-132's Shape A/B axis (near-term target: `(Shape A, Framing A)`). Introduces the **framing-exercise statement** required in flow skill metadata; flows without it cannot be promoted out of `lab`. Makes ADR-064 implementation completion flow-gated rather than roadmap-gated.
- `docs/adrs/ADR-138-flow-contract-schema.md` — accepted schema ADR. Commits the required shape for `manifests/flow-contract-schema.yaml` (twelve top-level fields including `flow_id`, `lifecycle_state`, `input_source.determinism`, `success_condition.verifier`, `sandboxed_write_paths`, `blocked_actions`, hardcoded `human_approval_required: true`, `evidence_shape` with anti-self-validation independence flags, `framing_exercise_statement`, `non_goals`, `falsifiable_when`). Schema stays in `exemplary` status until the second flow registers against it unchanged; extensions land as ADR-138a or new ADR. Updated to add eight new fields from ADR-139/141/142 (`credential_source`, `billing_identity`, `provider_capabilities`, `engram_project_scope`, `air_gapped_compatible`, `tenant_id`, `audit_class`).
- `docs/adrs/ADR-139-account-agnostic-multi-provider-runtime.md` — accepted ADR. Establishes caller-supplied credentials as the default for all COS surfaces, bans credential propagation from maintainer shell to cloud workers, defines three billing postures (`byok-maintainer`, `byok-project`, `proxied`), extends Rules §10 to provider SDK licenses, mandates generic env var names (`LLM_PRIMARY_API_KEY`), and requires `billing_identity` in every LLM audit row.
- `docs/adrs/ADR-140-cross-os-containerized-deployment.md` — accepted ADR. Defines a Docker Compose worker stack (`docker/cos-worker/docker-compose.yml`) for Linux/macOS/Windows+WSL2 cloud worker surfaces; satisfies `bootstrap-portability.md` for container deployments; no shell profile assumption; optional services remain optional via Compose profiles.
- `docs/adrs/ADR-141-engram-cloud-cross-instance-replication.md` — accepted ADR. Wires upstream `engram cloud` (April 2026) as a live-sync complement to the existing git-jsonl path. Three coexisting modes: `local-only`, `git-jsonl` (not deprecated), `engram-cloud`. Local SQLite authoritative; cloud replication-only. Project-scoped bearer tokens; `ENGRAM_CLOUD_ALLOWED_PROJECTS` tenant isolation; conflict surfacing reuses the propose-only contract. Introduces `scripts/cos-engram-cloud-enroll` bootstrap wrapper. Audit bridge to `agent-audit-trail.jsonl`.
- `docs/adrs/ADR-142-compliance-audit-air-gapped-surface.md` — accepted ADR. Formalises `.cognitive-os/runtime/agent-audit-trail.jsonl` as the canonical compliance evidence surface. Defines `audit_class` enumeration (seven classes covering SOC 2 / ISO 27001 / GDPR relevance), `tenant_id` per-flow isolation, air-gap deployment surface (local JSONL + git-jsonl), and GDPR erasure procedure. Classifies existing governance hooks as `access_control` evidence.
- `docs/architecture/dx-cloud-flow-bootstrap-plan.md` — updated: ADR-139..142 added as prerequisites before promoting flow #1 beyond `lab`; status updated to `ready-for-first-flow-lab`; companion docs list extended.

### Added — Operational Tooling and Discipline (ADRs 144–149, 168)

- ADR-144 — **Hook-Enforced Rule Projection Contract.** The mapping from
  rules to hooks is now contract-enforced; rule projections that do not
  reach a registered hook fail audit.
- ADR-145 — **Dependency Lane Split.** Heavy optional dependencies move out
  of `dev` into explicit lanes under `requirements/dependency-lanes/` so
  upstream pins on one lane (e.g. `cognee`/`kuzu`) cannot block core
  dependency hygiene. `pyproject.toml` `dev` extra now resolves to
  `[web,direct_providers,testing,enforcement]`.
- ADR-146 — **Primitive Readiness Ledger.** Each primitive carries an
  explicit readiness record consumed by the boring-reliability dashboard
  and by tier-claim auditing.
- ADR-147 — **Agent Capability Coverage Pipeline.** ACC pipeline measures
  what agents can/cannot achieve under the current primitive surface and
  surfaces gaps as a first-class metric. Wired into the statusline segment
  through `cos-coverage`.
- ADR-148 — **ADR Authoring Primitive.** ADR creation itself becomes a
  primitive with required schema, frontmatter, and admission contract;
  prevents drift in the most load-bearing decision artifact.
- ADR-149 — **Primitive Duplication Audit.** Audits the registry for
  semantic duplicates (different names, same effective surface) so the
  default-visible budget is not inflated by accidental re-implementations.
- ADR-168 — **Cross-Device Dependency Installation Contract.** Standardised
  install metadata so a primitive can declare its dependency requirements
  in a way that survives installation across machines and OSes; companion
  to ADR-140 (Docker Compose) and ADR-141 (engram cloud).

### Added — Self-Improvement Loop Extensions

- `lib/consumer_improvement_proposals.py` — consumer projects can now feed
  their own observations back through the propose-only contract.
- `lib/governed_self_improvement.py` — the self-improvement loop is now
  audited end-to-end as a closed governed flow, not as an isolated
  primitive.
- `lib/key_learning_capture.py`, `lib/dispatch_optimizer.py`,
  `lib/friction_telemetry.py`, `lib/adaptive_profile.py` — supporting
  primitives that feed the learning loop with structured signals.
- `lib/engram_obsidian_exporter.py` + `scripts/cos-engram-export-obsidian` —
  manual Engram export to an Obsidian vault for human review and
  cross-tool reading. Stop-hook variant included.

### Added — Architecture Documentation

- `docs/architecture/dx-cloud-flow-bootstrap-plan.md` — strategic plan for
  COS as runtime-of-prosthesis for cloud agent flows under human audit.
- `docs/architecture/agent-capability-coverage-pipeline.md` — ACC pipeline
  reference.
- `docs/architecture/bootstrap-portability.md` — cross-OS portability
  contract for installation and runtime.
- `docs/architecture/concurrency-safety-core-consumer-contract.md` —
  contract surface between core and consumer projects under concurrent
  use.
- `docs/architecture/consumer-project-primitive-accessibility.md` —
  accessibility guarantees for consumers.
- `docs/architecture/cos-instance-installer.md` /
  `cos-service-runtime-boundary.md` — installer and service-runtime
  boundaries.
- `docs/architecture/engram-command-contract.md` — Engram CLI contract.
- `docs/architecture/expected-skip-registry-and-opt-in-test-lanes.md` —
  classified skip registry; unit-lane skip policy is now explicit.
- `docs/architecture/gdpr-erasure-procedure.md` — GDPR erasure procedure
  companion to ADR-142.
- `docs/architecture/adr-closure-policy.md` — closure policy for ADRs that
  reach `accepted` and need their evidence linked.
- `docs/architecture/functional-audit/scorecard-hooks.md` — hook
  functional-audit scorecard.

### Changed

- `pyproject.toml` version bumped from `0.24.0` to `0.25.0`. The
  dependency-lane split (ADR-145) collapses the previously bundled `llm`,
  `observability`, `guardrails`, `jupyter`, `crawling`, `memory`,
  `semantic` extras out of the default `dev` extra; opt in per lane via
  `requirements/dependency-lanes/*`.
- `rich>=15` replaces the previous `rich>=14` pin; the upstream
  cognee/kuzu blocker that held `rich` at 14 lives in the `memory` lane
  now and no longer constrains core.

### Internal

- `manifests/hook-quality.yaml` — regenerated via `scripts/hook_quality_audit.py --sync` to register two auto-detected behavior tests for `task-completed` and `validation-lock-cleanup` hooks (drift surfaced by `derived-artifact-gate` during merge-to-main validation).
- `manifests/expected-skip-registry.yaml` and supporting audit — unit-lane
  skip policy classified explicitly; expected skips no longer hide as
  silent test passes.

### Falsifiable claims added (per release artefact discipline)

- **Embedded-runtime trajectory**: a flow without a
  `framing_exercise_statement` per ADR-137 cannot leave `lab`. If a flow
  reaches `core`/`team` without one, the trajectory is broken.
- **Closure discipline**: validator drift after a fast batch must be closed
  by `cos-closure-discipline-audit` before the batch can be claimed
  complete. If a drift entry remains open after a release tag, the
  discipline is broken.
- **ADR authoring primitive**: ADRs lacking the schema required by ADR-148
  cannot be admitted. If ADRs land without it, the primitive is
  decorative.
- **Primitive duplication audit**: the registry should not contain
  semantic duplicates after the audit runs. If `cos-primitive-duplication-audit`
  reports duplicates and they persist past the next release, the audit
  is decorative.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-05-03 — "Closed-Loop Self-Improvement and Shape B Runway"

This release lands the closed-loop self-improvement framework that the v0.23.0
case study identified as the natural follow-up. Three new ADRs (134–136) plus
one provenance-hardening commit add **four architectural ceilings** stacked on
top of the v0.23.0 boring-reliability doctrine. Each ceiling blocks a distinct
runaway class while preserving human review as a structural invariant.

The release also lands a Shape-B runway: infrastructure required for future
multi-maintainer / federated operation, built but not operated, with
trigger conditions converted from prose into observable counters.

### Added — Closed-Loop Self-Improvement (ADR-134, ADR-135)

- `scripts/cos-self-improvement-loop` (ADR-134) — converts control-plane audit
  findings into bounded operational proposals. `propose-only` mode hardcoded,
  `human_approval_required: true`, sandboxed write paths per proposal,
  blocked actions list (`auto_merge`, `auto_promote_core_or_team`,
  `invent_roi_evidence`, `delete_without_reversible_path`).
- `scripts/cos-self-improvement-discipline-gate` — wired into `cos-ci-local.sh`,
  enforces the proposer's own discipline contract.
- `scripts/cos-doctrine-proposer` (ADR-135) — generates proposed doctrine
  amendments as markdown under `docs/proposals/`. `runtime_effect: none`
  hardcoded; the system proposes new rules but never applies them.
- `lib/self_improvement_loop.py`, `lib/doctrine_proposer.py` — the core
  libraries. Each proposal includes `non_goals` (anti-patterns to avoid) so
  the proposer cannot accidentally propose its own over-correction.
- First doctrine-proposer run produced five concrete amendments derived from
  live audit data. One amendment ("prefer semantic matching over substring
  matching in gates") is structurally identical to a finding from the
  external SR review that triggered the v0.23.0 cycle, re-derived
  independently from the system's own `cos-false-positive-ledger`.

### Added — Shape B Runway (ADR-136)

- `manifests/agentic-primitive-registry.lock.yaml` — SHA-pinned manifest of
  every primitive (1,588 lines). Cross-machine instances can verify identical
  primitive sets deterministically.
- `manifests/skills/REGISTRY.lock` — version-pinned skill set.
- `manifests/federation-triggers.yaml` — converts ADR-132's prose trigger
  conditions for Shape B into observable counters. Six metrics
  (`active_maintainers`, `active_machines`, `concurrent_remote_writers`,
  `external_consumer_reports_30d`, `repeated_cross_machine_lock_conflicts`,
  `unsupervised_remote_agents`); each with current observed value and
  Shape-B trigger threshold. Audit fires when any observed value crosses
  its threshold.
- `scripts/cos-export-consumer-evidence` / `cos-import-consumer-evidence` —
  cross-instance evidence exchange. Imports are propose-only.
- `scripts/cos-engram-bundle` / `cos-engram-import-propose` — portable
  Engram bundle. Imports propose new observations; never auto-merge.
- `scripts/cos-federation-trigger-audit` — periodic audit of the
  observed-vs-trigger gap.
- `scripts/cos-cross-instance-drill` — manual rehearsal of the runway
  primitives end-to-end. A runway that is never rehearsed rusts; this drill
  exercises the full export → bundle → import-propose → registry-lock
  verification path without activating Shape B.

### Added — Anti-Self-Validation (commit `d4535df0`)

- `manifests/external-adoption-evidence.yaml` — schema for admissible
  external-help claims. Required: `independence.maintainer_owned: false`,
  `same_machine: false`, `same_repo: false`, `self_reported: false`, plus a
  `provenance.producer` block (type, identity, optional signature,
  timestamp). Evidence violating any `independence` flag is rejected as
  drill output, not as adoption signal.
- `scripts/cos_claim_signature_audit.py` extended — claims must carry signed
  provenance to count.
- First drill report (`docs/reports/cross-instance-consumer-e2e-2026-05-03.md`)
  applies the schema to its own output and explicitly disqualifies itself
  from signing the `helps-projects` claim. Doctrine applied recursively to
  its first verification artefact.

### Added — Case Study Sections

The external-review-cycle case study gained four new structural sections,
each documenting a property of the cycle distinct from the operational
narrative:

- *Self-evolving doctrine: when the audit subsystem proposes rules about itself*
- *Convergence: when internal proposals reproduce external review findings*
- *Runway-not-rocket: building Shape B's infrastructure without operating Shape B*
- The *Runway-not-rocket* section now also documents the fourth ceiling
  (anti-self-validation through required provenance) and the falsifiable
  claim it adds for external adopters.

The case study now has **seven meta-property sections** for external
adopters to use as a frame when evaluating governance systems.

### Changed

- `pyproject.toml` version bumped from `0.23.0` to `0.24.0`.
- The architectural posture documented as "three ceilings" (in the v0.23.0
  case study) is now four, with the fourth landing inline in the
  *Runway-not-rocket* section to keep all anti-runaway refusals in one
  table.

### Documentation

- ADR-134 — Headless Self-Improvement Proposer
- ADR-135 — Self-Evolving Doctrine Proposals
- ADR-136 — Cross-Instance Learning Runway
- `docs/architecture/cross-instance-learning-runway.md`
- `docs/architecture/headless-self-improvement-proposer.md`
- `docs/architecture/self-evolving-doctrine-proposals.md`
- `docs/reports/cross-instance-consumer-e2e-2026-05-03.md` — first drill
  report, intentionally self-disqualified per the new
  anti-self-validation rule.

### Falsifiable claims added (for external adopters)

- **Self-improvement loop**: subsequent runs against new audit data should
  produce new proposals when the data shifts. If the proposal set is static
  after months of audit evolution, the loop is broken.
- **Doctrine proposer**: the healthy zone is *partial convergence* with an
  independent external review. Zero convergence = loop too narrow; full
  convergence = loop hallucinating.
- **Shape B runway**: dormant runway with continuous trigger observability is
  healthy. Active runway with zero observed triggers = discipline broken.
  Triggers fired with no runway primitive activation = runway decorative.
- **Anti-self-validation**: `manifests/external-adoption-evidence.yaml` must
  not accumulate entries with `maintainer_owned: true` that sign product
  claims.

## [0.23.0] - 2026-05-03 — "Boring Reliability and the Audited Default Surface"

This release completes a single-session external-review absorption cycle (DX
assessment → ADRs → enforcement → demotions → doctrine update). The dominant
direction is **subtraction and maturity**, not addition: lifecycle states earn
their default-visible position through evidence; demotion is a first-class
operation; CI moves from GitHub-hosted to local pre-push gates.

### Added — Boring Reliability Control Plane

- `scripts/cos-boring-reliability` aggregator dashboard plus 9 sub-tools:
  `cos-adoption-profile`, `cos-preamble-budget`, `cos-default-visible-reducer`,
  `cos-false-positive-ledger`, `cos-wip-safety-score`, `cos-recovery-drill`,
  `cos-runtime-hook-reality`, `cos-silent-failure-audit`, `cos-dispatch-smoke`.
  Operator-readable signals replace prose-only reasoning about system health.
- `manifests/governance-maturity.yaml` — explicit `advisory` / `observe` /
  `blocking` labels for `trust-score-validator`, `blast-radius`, `review-spawner`.
  Product docs can no longer claim a check is blocking without evidence.
- `manifests/silent-failure-allowlist.yaml` — every `|| true` / `|| :` /
  `2>/dev/null` occurrence in hooks is now classified with a rationale and
  `max_occurrences`. Growth without classification fails the audit.
- `docs/architecture/boring-reliability-control-plane.md` — operating doctrine
  for default-visible primitives: real / measurable / reversible / honest /
  evidence-backed.
- `docs/architecture/cognitive-prosthesis.md` — rationale companion explaining
  why the system has the shape it has.

### Added — Adoption Profiles and Lifecycle Discipline

- Adoption tiers `core` / `team` / `maintainer` / `lab` (ADR-124) with
  `cos-active-primitive-index` enforcing default-visible thresholds
  (`VISIBLE_WARN_THRESHOLD=12`, `VISIBLE_FAIL_THRESHOLD=25`) wired into local CI.
- Eight lifecycle states (ADR-126: `candidate` → `sandbox` → `advisory` →
  `blocking` → `default-on` → `demoted` → `archived` → `deleted`) with
  required `demotion_evidence` and `sunset_criteria` on demoted entries.
- `scripts/cos-tier-claim-audit` + `tests/audit/test_adr_tier_claims.py` —
  ADRs claiming `tier: core`/`team` must include machine-readable evidence
  blocks linking to control-plane output (ADR-133).
- `scripts/lab_first_promotion_gate.py` — every new primitive starts in
  `lab`/`sandbox`; promotion requires evidence (ADR-133).
- First two demotions executed with evidence: `hooks/task-completed.sh`
  and `hooks/context-watchdog.sh` projection.

### Added — Local CI Migration (replaces GitHub Actions)

- `scripts/cos-ci-local.sh` — tiered runner (`quick` / `full` / `deep`)
  consolidating the seven ubuntu-equivalent workflows. Pre-push default
  targets ~30s wall-clock (ADR-131).
- `git-hooks/pre-push` + `scripts/install-git-hooks.sh` — tracked git hook
  activated via `core.hooksPath`. Bypass with `--no-verify` or
  `COS_PRE_PUSH_SKIP=1`.
- Three weekly `launchd` schedules via `scripts/install-launchd-jobs.sh`
  replacing the cron-style workflows: config-audit (Mon 09:00),
  public-metrics (Mon 12:00), primitive-gap (Mon 12:30).
- `scripts/cos-pr-review.sh` — manual `prep` / `post` CLI replacing the three
  Claude API workflows. Zero per-PR API cost.

### Added — Data Layer Integrity (ADR-128)

- Engram wrapper-level upsert: `lib/engram_client.save_observation()` searches
  for `(project, topic_key)` matches before save; routes exact matches to HTTP
  update instead of appending duplicates.
- Engram rank-derived score fallback in `lib/engram_lifecycle`: when the
  binary returns no numeric `score`, the differential signal no longer
  collapses to `1.0`.
- Engram daemon-down visibility: `engram-daemon-down.jsonl` metric is written
  when reinforcement cannot reach the daemon. Failures are no longer silent.
- SDD topic-key namespace canonicalised to `planning/{change}/...`. Legacy
  `sdd/*` keys remain read-fallbacks (ADR-128 §6).
- `tests/audit/test_version_consistency.py` — `pyproject.toml` version must
  match the latest released `CHANGELOG.md` heading.
- `tests/audit/test_sdd_topic_keys.py` — canonical SDD namespace audit.

### Added — Safety Hardening

- `hooks/_lib/safe-worktree-remove.sh` (ADR-129) — replaces the
  `--force || rm -rf` antipattern across four callsites with a helper that
  captures git stderr, logs to `.cognitive-os/metrics/worktree-removals.jsonl`,
  and never falls back to `rm -rf` unless `COS_WORKTREE_REMOVE_ALLOW_RM_RF=1`.
- Semantic-scope refactor of `destructive-git-blocker.sh`,
  `direct-main-guard.sh`, and `orchestrator-claim-gate.sh` — substring-match
  false positives reduced by parsing actual command shape.
- `direct-main-guard.sh` now requires `COS_DIRECT_MAIN_BYPASS_REASON` for
  bypasses and appends each event to `.cognitive-os/metrics/direct-main-bypass.jsonl`.
- `cos_false_positive_ledger.py` — match scope tightened from full-event
  text to `event_type` / `bypass_kind` fields, eliminating filename-string
  false positives.

### Added — Strategic Decisions

- ADR-132 — Solo-Swarm vs Multi-Maintainer Fork (`exploration`). Names the
  trigger conditions for re-shaping the system from single-maintainer
  (Shape A) to multi-maintainer (Shape B). Recommends staying in Shape A
  until trigger fires.
- ADR-133 — Expansion Without Monsterization. Lab-first admission contract
  with required evidence blocks for `core` / `team` tiers.

### Changed

- All eleven GitHub Actions workflows renamed to `.disabled` (ADR-130). The
  `.disabled` extension takes them out of GHA auto-discovery while preserving
  YAML in the repo as documentation. Restoration is per-file rename.
- `pyproject.toml` version bumped from `0.22.0` to `0.23.0`.
- `core` adoption profile preamble files now include `AGENTS.md` so the
  preamble-budget tool reflects the full context tax.
- Architecture readiness fails when projected hooks are not represented in
  the lifecycle manifest — readiness can no longer report green while
  undercounting runtime surface.
- Boring-reliability dashboard distinguishes `warn` from `fail` exit codes
  cleanly: `warn` does not escalate to non-zero, `fail` does.

### Fixed

- Engram upsert no longer creates duplicate observations on repeated save
  with the same `topic_key` (ADR-128 §1).
- `cos_false_positive_ledger` no longer inflates counts by matching filenames
  in event payloads (`adaptive-bypass.jsonl` was firing on every so-vitals
  heartbeat tick).
- Multiple substring-match gates no longer false-positive on legitimate
  commit messages, push commands, and command bodies.
- `pyproject.toml` and `CHANGELOG.md` versions are now CI-enforced to match.

  baseline of the 10 control-plane tools.

### Removed

- Three Claude-API GitHub Actions workflows (`claude-interactive`,
  `claude-issue-triage`, `claude-pr-review`) suspended by rename to
  `.disabled` — no per-PR API cost.
- macOS-matrix workflow (`cross-platform`) suspended — was the largest
  remaining cost driver after the Claude-API workflows.
- Seven additional ubuntu workflows suspended in favour of local-CI
  replacement (ADR-131).

## [0.22.0] - 2026-04-30

- **Test runner ergonomics** (ADR-072): Lane taxonomy with `.cognitive-os/test-lanes.yaml` as source of truth. New `cos-test focused/cluster/broad` escalation ladder. Auto-marker injection in conftest. Audit and contracts lanes now parallel (~40% wall-time reduction observed). Makefile `test-*` targets deprecated; redirect to cos-test (1 release cycle). Originally proposed as ADR-069; renumbered after the slot was claimed by `research-first-protocol`.

## [0.21.0] - 2026-04-28 — "Portable Runtime, Memory Lifecycle, and Developer Confidence"

### Added

- Codex-first host tooling verification with a doctor that checks active harness, settings driver JSON, declared dependencies, Engram CLI, Engram MCP startup, and Codex config wiring.
- Cached SessionStart host-doctor execution so Codex and Claude installs can surface toolchain drift automatically without paying the full diagnostic cost on every session.
- Memory lifecycle portability checks and documentation covering SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, Stop, Engram daemon launch, session resume, session changelog, and crystallization flows.
- Harness driver parity audit docs/tests to compare canonical Cognitive OS agentic primitives against Claude/Codex driver projections.
- Developer-confidence product positioning: Cognitive OS improves trust in AI-assisted development through memory, guardrails, recovery, portable checks, and lightweight defaults.
- Session summary reminder Stage A/B hooks: first remind/block for missing `mem_session_summary`, then provide a heuristic Engram auto-save fallback on repeated Stop attempts.

### Changed

- Preserved the installed harness and settings driver in `.cognitive-os/install-meta.json` so pull/push auto-update flows do not fall back to Claude when Codex markers are also present.
- Enforced native Codex projection paths so Codex installs no longer treat `.claude/` as the runtime center of gravity.
- Canonicalized memory hook environment resolution around `COGNITIVE_OS_*`, `CODEX_*`, and `CLAUDE_*` variables instead of Claude-only project/session assumptions.
- Dropped an excluded Engram driver projection from rules and clarified automatic memory semantics: shell hooks can persist local lifecycle evidence and reminders, while `mem_session_summary` remains an agent MCP tool call.

### Fixed

- Repaired post-SIGALRM test contract drift and replaced SIGALRM-based timeout fixtures with `pytest-timeout`-compatible behavior.
- Hardened hook latency tests to avoid flaky wall-clock/observability false signals.
- Stabilized the broad repair lane by removing stale observability assumptions and aligning hook latency targets.
- Isolated integration fixtures with `monkeypatch` and `tmp_path` to avoid cross-test state leakage.

### Documentation

- Added Codex host tooling verification runbook and memory lifecycle quick map.
- Added ADR-064 implementation plan covering remaining harness-agnostic surfaces, P0 sequence, and verification suite design.
- Documented developer-confidence positioning as a product artifact.
- Recorded release/handoff context for the v0.20.0-to-v0.21.0 stabilization cycle.


## [0.20.0] - 2026-04-27 — "ADR-071: Engram Lifecycle Evolution (Phases 1–3)"

### Added — confidence + Ebbinghaus decay (Phase 1, commit `d48dcb8`)

- `lib/engram_lifecycle.py` — wrapper layer with `save`/`search`/`reinforce`, `decay_retention(t,τ)`, `reinforce_confidence(c,β=0.15)`, `adjusted_score(base,conf,ret,α=0.3)`. Six decay classes (architecture=365d, decision=180d, pattern=180d, discovery=90d, bugfix=60d, manual=90d). Lifecycle metadata stored as a `<engram-lifecycle>{...}</engram-lifecycle>` trailer in observation `content` so engram passes it through unchanged.
- `tests/unit/test_engram_lifecycle.py` — 22+ unit tests (trailer round-trip, decay math, reinforcement asymptote, ranking bounds, search re-ranking, decay-class mapping, malformed-trailer fallback).
- `hooks/engram-reinforce-on-access.sh` — async PostToolUse hook for `mem_search`/`mem_get_observation`. Registered in both `apply-efficiency-profile.sh` and `set-security-profile.sh`.

### Added — HTTP correction + safety policy (Wave 3a, commit `f2cd0aa`)

- `lib/engram_http_client.py` — REST wrapper for the engram daemon at port 7437. `is_available`, `get_observation`, `search_observations`, `get_recent`, `update_observation`, `create_observation`. `urllib` fallback when `requests` is absent. **Empty-PATCH raises `ValueError`** as a destructive-op preflight.
- `lib/engram_lifecycle.py` `reinforce()` rewritten to use HTTP `PATCH /observations/{id}` — true in-place update, no duplicate observations. The Phase 1 caveat ("engram CLI lacks `get`/`update`") was wrong; HTTP API exposes both. Corrected with addendum in ADR-071.
- `rules/engram-api-safety.md` — ratified after observation #13283 was accidentally overwritten during API discovery. Production daemon mutation only via typed clients; ad-hoc `curl PATCH/POST/DELETE` must target a sandboxed daemon (`ENGRAM_DATA_DIR=$tmp ENGRAM_PORT=7438 engram serve`).

### Added — crystallization (Phase 2, commit `f2cd0aa`)

- `lib/engram_crystallizer.py` — deterministic synthesis (no LLM in v1) when a `topic_key` crosses thresholds (`revision_count ≥ 5` in 30 days OR `≥ 10` total). Saves digest as `type=pattern`, `topic_key=<original>/crystallized`, with `crystallized:true` + `superseded_obs_ids: [...]` in trailer. Idempotent via topic-key check.
- `hooks/engram-crystallize-on-session-end.sh` — async Stop hook calling `crystallize_all()`. Latency budget ≤500ms with short-circuit on empty candidates.
- `tests/unit/test_engram_crystallizer.py` — coverage for thresholds, candidate detection, idempotence, synthesize_content determinism, force=True replacement.

### Added — graph traversal (Phase 3, commit `f2cd0aa`)

- `lib/engram_graph_walker.py` — BFS over the `memory_relations` SQLite table opened **read-only** (`sqlite3.connect(f"file:{path}?mode=ro", uri=True)`). Excludes `judgment_status='rejected'`. Default `max_depth=2`, `graph_boost=0.3`, `alpha_graph=0.2`.
- `EngramLifecycle.search(graph_walk=True)` triggers traversal and merges neighbors into the ranked result set.
- `tests/unit/test_engram_graph_walker.py` — BFS correctness, depth limit, deduplication, rejected-relation skip, score merging.

### Added — end-to-end test harness

- `tests/e2e/test_engram_lifecycle_e2e.py` — 14 e2e tests against a **real sandboxed engram daemon** spawned on a free port with `ENGRAM_DATA_DIR=tempdir`. Marked `@pytest.mark.e2e`. Skipped automatically when the `engram` binary is absent. Total test count: **135 pass** (121 unit + 14 e2e).

### Documentation

- `docs/adrs/ADR-071-engram-lifecycle-evolution.md` — full decision (schema, formulas, decay classes, ranking weight α=0.3, asymptotic confidence β=0.15) + two addendums (HTTP discovery + Phase 2/3 shipped) + **Honest Limitations** section listing 12 caveats: heuristic synthesis, supersedes-not-written, local-only reinforcement, schema coupling, save-count proxy, dormant hooks, unvalidated thresholds, structural-only cloud-sync compat, etc.
- `docs/research/llm-wiki-v2-engram-evolution-2026-04-27.md` — analysis of the LLM Wiki v2 gist (rohitg00/agentmemory) + 14 sources + post-implementation status footer.
- `.cognitive-os/plans/features/engram-lifecycle-evolution.md` — phased plan, marked SHIPPED for Phases 1–3, Phase 4 (Obsidian export) deferred.

### Notes

- Engram cloud branch (`feat/integrate-engram-cloud`) was inspected and confirmed **behind main by 10 commits** — cloud is already merged. The lifecycle trailer survives sync because it lives in `content`, but cross-device reinforcement aggregation is **not** implemented.
- The hook `engram-reinforce-on-access.sh` requires `engram serve` (port 7437) to be running. If down, `reinforce()` returns `False` silently and the failure is observable in `.cognitive-os/metrics/lifecycle-reinforcement.jsonl`.
- This is the implementation referenced in [LLM Wiki v2](https://gist.github.com/rohitg00/2067ab416f7bbe447c1977edaaa681e2). Phases 1–3 cover lifecycle (confidence + decay), crystallization, and graph traversal — i.e. everything the gist identifies as the load-bearing additions to a flat-page Karpathy wiki.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-04-27 — "ADR-068 Phase 1: Adaptive Pytest"

### Added — ADR-068 Phase 1: adaptive pytest worker selection

- `scripts/detect_runner_capacity.py` — cross-platform helper implementing the 6-row heuristic table (cores≤2→serial, load>70%→2, mem<2GB→4, battery<30% off-AC→serial, CI=true→auto, default→auto). Emits scalar token to stdout (`auto`/`0`/integer); `--json` flag exposes full diagnostics dict.
- `scripts/pytest-with-summary.sh` now invokes the detector when no `-n`/`--numprocesses` flag is present, preventing the 21-min serial regression that triggered the ADR. Explicit `-n` and `COS_PYTEST_WORKERS` env var both short-circuit detection per the override precedence chain.
- `tests/unit/test_detect_runner_capacity.py` — 9 unit tests covering each heuristic row, override precedence, and JSON diagnostics. psutil-missing path is exercised via mocked import failure; production path degrades to `auto` with a stderr warning.
- ADR-068 status: **Proposed → Accepted**.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-04-27 — "cos-init Python + Defense-in-Depth Complete"

### Added — cos-init.sh fully migrated to Python (strangler-fig complete)

- `scripts/cos_init.py` — full Python implementation of cos-init flow (Python 3.11+, stdlib + pyyaml)
- `scripts/cos-init.sh` collapsed from **711 → 5 lines** (exec shim for backward compat with `bash scripts/cos-init.sh`)
- 6 functions migrated through strangler-fig phases (2.1 → 2.final):
  - Phase 2.1 (`8a4778c`): `detect_harness()`
  - Phase 2.2 (`39dd40c`): `scope_allows()` + `skill_scope_allows()`
  - Phase 2.3 (`7fde5f9`): `install_rule()` + `install_hook()` + `install_skill_dir()`
  - Phase 2.final (`31f0002`): all 12 procedural sections (stack detection, mode components, dir structure, rules/hooks/skills install, templates, cognitive-os.yaml write, efficiency profile filtering, settings.json merge, install-meta, registry registration, gitignore update, summary)
- 47 unit tests + 29 parity tests + 72 integration tests pass post-migration
- Per ADR-066 polyglot policy: bash kebab-case shim retained, Python snake_case implementation owns the logic

### Added — ADR-067 Phase 2 defense-in-depth (rules + hooks + ADRs)

Extends the template + hook + audit pattern from `skills/*/SKILL.md` (Phase 1) to 3 more artifact types:

- `templates/rule-template.md`, `templates/hook-template.sh`, `templates/adr-template.md` — canonical skeletons with `<REQUIRED>` placeholders
- `hooks/rule-frontmatter-validator.sh` — PostToolUse Edit/Write hook for `rules/*.md`. Validates SCOPE, H1, opening section, conditional `## Contextual Trigger`. Advisory by default; BLOCK opt-in via `COS_STRICT_RULE_VALIDATION=1`.
- `hooks/hook-header-validator.sh` — for `hooks/*.sh`. Validates shebang, SCOPE, PURPOSE, EVENT, `set -euo pipefail`. Grandfathers existing 154 hooks (only enforces for new). `COS_STRICT_HOOK_VALIDATION=1`.
- `hooks/adr-section-validator.sh` — for `docs/adrs/ADR-*.md`. Validates required sections (Status, Context, Decision, Consequences, Alternatives rejected, Verification with ≥1 fenced code block). Cutoff at ADR-067 — pre-067 ADRs grandfathered. `COS_STRICT_ADR_VALIDATION=1`.
- All 3 hooks: fast-path filter (skip Python startup if input doesn't match path pattern), bash 3.x compatible
- Hook registration in: `apply-efficiency-profile.sh` + `set-security-profile.sh` + 3 hook-architecture-v2 profile JSONs
- Audit tests extended: `test_rules_enforcement.py` (+4 tests), `test_hooks_contracts.py` (+1 contract), new `test_adr_contracts.py` (+5 tests)
- `/add-rule` and `/add-hook` skills updated to reference their templates
- ADR-068 self-bootstrap fix: its own `## Verification` section now has a code block (caught by the new audit test)

### Added — deps-update v2 (MCP-aware)

Lessons from the 2026-04-27 engram MCP outage codified into tooling:

- `scripts/deps-update.sh` — engram section rewritten brew-first (instead of `go install`):
  - `brew update` + `brew install/upgrade` preferred (Operon-safe path)
  - `which -a engram` multi-path conflict detection with symlink fix suggestions
  - Backup-before-replace (timestamped `.bak`)
  - `⚠️  Restart Claude Code` reminder when binary changed
- `scripts/check_mcp_servers.py` — diagnostic script: reads MCP configs, resolves binaries via `which -a`, checks process via `pgrep`, reports version. `--json` mode for machine readers.
- `tests/unit/test_check_mcp_servers.py` — 8 tests covering standalone config, mcpServers format, plugin-bundled config, multi-path detection, missing-process WARN, missing-binary ERROR, JSON output validity.
- `docs/tooling-update-protocol.md` (new, 147 lines) — protocol for updating any Claude Code-integrated tool. Covers 3-paths trap, MCP restart requirement, brew vs go install vs manual, verification post-update, rollback. Living example: engram 2026-04-27 case study.
- `skills/deps-update/SKILL.md` — adds 4 new sections: brew-first flow, multi-path resolution trap, MCP server lifecycle, backup/rollback.

### Changed — Breaking (pre-1.0)

- **`scripts/cos-init.sh` is now a shim** — all logic lives in `scripts/cos_init.py`. Functionally backward compatible (CI / `install.sh` / docs all invoke `bash scripts/cos-init.sh`), but `--internal-call` dispatcher is the only Python-direct entry point now.

### Fixed

- **engram MCP server outage** (manual fix, no commit): `~/go/bin/engram v1.13.1` was SIGKILL'd by macOS Operon Sandbox when spawned from Claude Code. Resolution: `brew install gentleman-programming/tap/engram` → v1.14.5 + symlinks unified across `~/.local/bin/engram` + `~/go/bin/engram` → both point to brew canonical install. Engram MCP now operational, `mem_save`/`mem_search` available across sessions. Documented in engram observation `tooling/engram-mcp-fix` (#13280).

### Added — Tests

- `tests/unit/test_cos_init_py.py` — 47 unit tests across 6 functions
- `tests/behavior/test_cos_init_parity_2_1.py` + `_2_2.py` + `_2_3.py` — 29 parity tests (Python output == bash output, byte-for-byte)
- `tests/audit/test_adr_contracts.py` (new) — 5 tests including monotonic-warn for ADR numbering gaps
- `tests/unit/test_check_mcp_servers.py` — 8 tests

### Verified

- 76 unit + parity tests pass (2.59s)
- 72 integration tests pass (3m 26s) including `test_fresh_install_canary` full + idempotent upgrade
- 1813 audit tests pass, 0 failures (post-Phase-2 add)
- Live install test: 3 scratch directories (node --default, python --full, go --harness=codex) all produce correct output

### Operator decisions accepted (from research-first triage)

- **9 cos-init migration decisions**: pyyaml, defer generate-project-settings, inline detect_harness, keep bash shim, subprocess.run, tomllib+tomli fallback, both unit+parity tests, strangler-fig, drop bash 3.x constraint
- **9 ADR-067 Phase 2 decision points + 5 open questions**: WARN advisory default, ADR-067 cutoff (no pre-067 backfill), grandfather 154 existing hooks, flat templates/, extend existing audit tests where possible, CI-gated, integrate with /add-rule + /add-hook skills, conditional Contextual Trigger enforcement, ≥1 fenced code block in ADR Verification, monotonic ADR numbering WARN not BLOCK

### Known issues (deferred)

- **125 unanswered operator decisions** still surfaced by `/decision-triage` (mostly historical ADR open questions; today's research reports' decisions all answered).
- **`rich 14→15`**: blocked by cognee[memory] pin `rich<13.7.0` — pending cognee upstream upgrade.
- **`wrapt 1→2`**: deferred until OpenTelemetry transitives validate 2.x.
- **hermes-agent `default_backend()` cleanup**: 3 files, ~30 min, before cryptography 49.0.0.
- Phase 2 of `/add-rule` and `/add-hook` skill updates: templates referenced; full automation deferred.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-04-25 — "Defense-in-Depth + Research-First"

### Added — ADR-065 Tech Radar Curation Pipeline

- `docs/adrs/ADR-065-radar-update-curation-pipeline.md` — design for `/radar-update` skill
- `skills/radar-update/SKILL.md` + `scripts/radar_merge.py` — Phase 1: skill + merge engine + dry-run
- `tests/unit/test_radar_merge.py` — 28 tests covering dedup, human-field preservation, classification routing, classification shift, fuzzy match, artifact parser, CHANGELOG updater, diff generation

### Added — ADR-066 Polyglot Language Boundaries

- `docs/adrs/ADR-066-polyglot-language-boundaries.md` — bash/Python/Go role matrix + naming conventions + migration triggers
- `rules/python-naming.md` + `tests/audit/test_python_naming.py` — Python `snake_case` enforcement
- `rules/bash-naming.md` + `tests/audit/test_bash_naming.py` — bash kebab-case enforcement
- `.github/workflows/go-quality.yml` — `gofmt -l` + `go vet` CI gates for 3 Go modules

### Added — ADR-067 SKILL.md Defense-in-Depth (Phase 1)

- `docs/adrs/ADR-067-frontmatter-defense-in-depth.md` — 3-layer defense pattern (template + hook + audit)
- `templates/skill-template.md` — canonical SKILL.md skeleton with explicit `<REQUIRED>` placeholders
- `hooks/skill-frontmatter-validator.sh` — PostToolUse Edit/Write hook (advisory by default, blocks on `COS_STRICT_SKILL_VALIDATION=1`); fast-path skips Python startup when input doesn't contain `SKILL.md` (17ms vs 70ms)
- `tests/audit/test_skill_descriptions_nonempty.py` — 3 audit tests using fixed `_fm()` parser
- Hook registered in 5 places (apply-efficiency-profile + set-security-profile + 3 hook-architecture-v2 profile JSONs)

### Added — ADR-068 Adaptive Test Runner Capacity

- `docs/adrs/ADR-068-adaptive-test-runner-capacity.md` — cross-platform heuristic for choosing `-n auto|N|0` based on CPU/memory/load/battery/CI

### Added — ADR-069 Research-First Protocol

- `docs/adrs/ADR-069-research-first-protocol.md` — 3-phase cycle (research → operator triage → implementation) for high-risk changes (4-dimensional risk scoring)
- `templates/agent-research-only.md` — boilerplate for research-only agent prompts
- `rules/research-first-protocol.md` + `tests/audit/test_research_reports_format.py` — operational policy + audit gate
- 3 research reports landed using the protocol:
  - `docs/reports/cos-init-migration-2026-04-24.md` — feasibility analysis (9 decision points)
  - `docs/reports/adr-067-phase-2-2026-04-24.md` — defense-in-depth Phase 2 scope (15 decisions)
  - `docs/reports/python-major-bumps-2026-04-24.md` — wrapt/rich/cryptography probe

### Added — Skills

- `/repo-scout` (renamed from `/eval-repo`, v2.0): scout external git repos for tech radar with bulk mode (`--batch <file>`), per-repo markdown artifacts, adoption signals (issue velocity, release cadence, CI health). Old `/eval-repo` kept as deprecated alias stub.
- `/radar-update` (Phase 1): merge `/repo-scout` evaluations into `docs/patterns/ecosystem-tools.md` + `docs/blocked-tools.md` with dry-run by default
- `/decision-triage`: aggregate unanswered operator decisions across research reports + ADRs into a single ranked view. Score-based urgency heuristic (initial 0/125 critical → 33/125 critical after improved scoring).
- `/deps-update`: automated audit + upgrade across Python deps, engram binary, Claude Code plugins, Docker images. Modes: `--audit` (default), `--apply`, `--apply --major`, `--dry-run`.

### Added — Auditing

- `tests/audit/test_python_naming.py`, `tests/audit/test_bash_naming.py` — naming convention enforcement
- `tests/audit/test_skill_descriptions_nonempty.py` — frontmatter contract enforcement
- `tests/audit/test_research_reports_format.py` — research report structure validation
- `tests/audit/test_packages_hooks_lib_symlinks.py` — packages/*/hooks/_lib symlink integrity
- `docs/architecture/parser-coverage-audit-2026-04-24.md` — audit of 12 sibling parsers for `_fm()`-class gaps

### Changed — Breaking (pre-1.0)

- **35 Python scripts renamed** from kebab-case to snake_case (`scripts/*-*.py` → `scripts/*_*.py`). 143 caller files updated atomically. Backward compat: zero (no aliases). See `rules/python-naming.md` for migration table.
- **`/eval-repo` → `/repo-scout`** (skill rename). Old name kept as deprecated alias.
- **`cognee` removed from `[dev]` extra** — moved to `[memory]` extra. Reason: `kuzu` (cognee transitive) fails to build with `make clean` errors, blocking normal `uv sync --extra dev`. Opt-in explicitly with `uv sync --extra memory`.

### Fixed

- **`lib/session_hygiene._fm()` parser**: regex required `^---` at absolute file start, but every SKILL.md begins with `<!-- SCOPE: ... -->\n---`. 18 skills appeared as "No description" in CATALOG.md. Fix: `re.MULTILINE` flag + multi-line block scalar handling. Result: 0 "No description" entries.
- **2 sibling parsers had same bug**: `lib/pattern_detector._parse_frontmatter_keys` + `lib/smart_access.get_skill_frontmatter`. Same fix applied.
- **`packages/quality-gates/hooks/_lib` symlink missing** — caused `completion-gate.sh` crash. Fix: created symlink + audit test. Bonus: 17 OTHER `packages/*/hooks/` directories had the same latent bug — all fixed in one pass.
- **35 hyphenated Python script names** caused pytest importlib hacks + Python 3.14 dataclass resolution failures. Fix: snake_case rename + enforcement rule.
- **17 `gofmt` debt files** — cleared with `gofmt -w` (precondition for go-quality.yml CI to be green).
- **5 perf flakes under `-n auto`** — `@pytest.mark.xdist_group("perf")` to serialize within xdist (not `@pytest.mark.flaky`).
- **Project registry pollution** (post-v0.16.0): 3 stale "target" duplicates from pytest fixtures removed. Registry: 10 → 7 real entries.
- **Hook bookkeeping after `skill-frontmatter-validator.sh` add**: scorecard 154→155, baselines regenerated, orphan-hooks contract restored.
- **Rule bookkeeping after `bash-naming.md` add**: classified in CORE_RULES, stale file refs in pedagogical examples removed.

### Documentation

- `docs/architecture/cos-update-vs-cos-cli-responsibility-analysis.md` — bash orchestrator vs Go package manager scope clarity (commit `583dc5c`)
- `rules/research-first-protocol.md` — when to use research-first vs background agents (4-dim scoring)

### Performance

- `hooks/contextual-rule-loader.sh` — already shipped in 0.16.0 (17x speedup); no regressions in 0.17.0
- `hooks/skill-frontmatter-validator.sh` fast-path — 70ms → 17ms per non-skill invocation
- `scripts/decision_triage.py` urgency heuristic — score-based (was returning 0 critical for 125 real decisions)

### Verified

- Python 7148/7154 unit tests pass (6 perf flakes confirmed under `-n auto`, all pass `-p no:xdist`)
- Shard-B 3967/3988 pass (21 pre-existing flakes from install-test resource contention, all pass `-p no:xdist`)
- 162 provider tests pass post-refactor

### Known issues (deferred)

- **Research report dual-location**: `.cognitive-os/reports/research/` (gitignored) vs `docs/reports/` — 3 reports exist in both, causing duplicates in `/decision-triage` output. Will be unified in next session.
- **rich 14→15 upgrade blocked**: `cognee[memory]` pins `rich<13.7.0`, breaking `[dev]+[memory]` combo. Reverted to `rich>=14`. Pending: cognee upstream upgrade.
- **wrapt 1→2** + **cryptography deprecated `default_backend()` in hermes-agent**: deferred per `docs/reports/python-major-bumps-2026-04-24.md`.
- **125 unanswered operator decisions** surfaced by `/decision-triage` (33 critical from today's research reports).

## [0.16.0] - 2026-04-24 — "Multi-Provider + Harness-Agnostic"

### Added — ADR-062 Multi-Provider Agent Loop

- `packages/llm-providers/` — 7 provider wrappers (qwen, openrouter, gemini, ollama, openai, deepseek, claude_sdk) behind uniform `REGISTRY` interface. Symlinked at `lib/providers`.
- `lib/openai_compatible_agent_loop.py` — generalized loop (renamed from `qwen_agent_loop.py`, which remains as a 65-line backward-compat shim).
- `lib/dispatch.py` — N-provider cascade with `ADVANCE_ON_ANY_FAILURE` vs `ADVANCE_ON_RATE_LIMIT_ONLY` policies; reads `llm_providers:` config block from `cognitive-os.yaml`.
- `scripts/smoke-multi-provider-fallback.sh` — per-provider smoke test with SIGALRM timeout (Unix-only).
- `/llm-status` skill v2.0.0 — provider inventory (tier, configured Y/N, advance policy, model_map); env key names detected (never values).
- Default cascade: `qwen,openrouter,gemini,ollama,claude` (zero direct Anthropic API key path). `openai`, `deepseek`, `claude_sdk` are opt-in.

### Added — ADR-063 Agent() Replication Strategy

- `docs/adrs/ADR-063-agent-tool-replication-strategy.md` — reject full Agent() clone; adopt Python `claude-agent-sdk` (MIT) as triple-gated opt-in provider.
- `pyproject.toml` — `claude-sdk = ["claude-agent-sdk>=0.1"]` optional dep.

### Added — ADR-064 Harness-Agnostic Cognitive OS

- `docs/adrs/ADR-064-harness-agnostic-cognitive-os.md` — architectural decision for Codex/Cursor/bare-CLI support. Names 4 integration surfaces (event capture, hook registration, skill invocation, sub-agent spawning). 10-15 session roadmap.

### Added — ADR-058 Phoenix Observability

- Langfuse purged. Phoenix OTel replaces it as the observability backend.
- `/phoenix-trace-ui` skill.

### Added — ADR-060 Local-Only Policy

- `docs/adrs/ADR-060-local-only-optional-services.md` — pip-first, Docker-fallback, never-cloud-default.
- Opik removed. MemU wired with self-contained `memu-pg` backend.
- Profile-gated services: `cognee`, `nemo-guardrails`, `jupyter` behind `--profile memory|guardrails|jupyter`.
- `scripts/cos-bootstrap.sh` `--profile full` now correctly activates all three profiles (was silent no-op).

### Added — ADR-061 Focus Narrative + External Evidence

- `README.md` rewritten governance-first (leads with "governance layer for coding agents").
- `docs/vs-alternatives.md` — comparison with Hermes, Agent Zero, OpenClaw.
- `docs/migration-from/{vanilla-claude-code,hermes}.md` — recipe-style migration docs.
- `scripts/demo-governance.sh` — 5-minute governance value demo.
- `.github/workflows/weekly-public-metrics.yml` — Monday cron, updates badges (dogfood-score, REAL%, hook-wiring).

### Added — Measurement & Observability

- `/dogfood-score` — composite SO self-build maturity score (7 dimensions).
- `/component-reality-check` — drill-down into REAL/DORMANT/ASPIRATIONAL/METADATA classification for agentic primitives.
- `aspirational-audit.py` — new `ON_DEMAND` classification label.
- `scripts/so-vs-vanilla-benchmark.py` — A/B test harness with `COS_DISABLE_ALL_GOVERNANCE=1` master kill-switch.

### Added — Dependency Maintenance

- `scripts/deps-update.sh` — automated audit + upgrade (Python/engram binary/plugins/Docker). Modes: `--audit` (default), `--apply`, `--apply --major`, `--dry-run`. Handles GOBIN-versioned-path trap.
- `/deps-update` skill (os-only, haiku).
- `/validate-release` paso 6: advisory deps audit call (non-blocking).

### Added — Project Scaffold

- 10 pilot skill unit tests (+7.12 skill_coverage): `audit-integrity`, `bump-version`, `compat-test`, `doc-sync`, `dod-check`, `evaluate-plan`, `exhaustive-prompt`, `invariant-check`, `session-backlog`, `validate-config`.

### Changed — Breaking (pre-1.0)

- **Langfuse removed** — replaced by Phoenix OTel (ADR-058).
- **Opik removed** — replaced by MemU self-contained backend (ADR-060).
- `lib/qwen_agent_loop.py` → `lib/openai_compatible_agent_loop.py` (shim preserves backward compat but file is now deprecated).
- `lib/providers/` is a symlink into `packages/llm-providers/lib/` (new package).

### Changed — Dependencies

- `uv sync --upgrade`: pydantic 2.12.5 → 2.13.3, openai 2.30.0 → 2.32.0, click 8.1.8 → 8.3.3, certifi 2026.2.25 → 2026.4.22 (CA bundle), +transitives. Skipped major bumps: wrapt 1→2, rich 14→15, cryptography 46→47 (queued for dedicated review).
- engram binary: `dev` build → `v1.13.1` (via `go install`). `~/.local/bin/engram v1.10.2` remains as MCP server path (macOS Operon sandbox blocks the go-installed binary — documented in code).

### Fixed

- **Hook chain 17x speedup**: `contextual-rule-loader.sh` 2200ms → 130ms. Root cause: O(n×m) subprocess forks iterating rules × patterns. Fix: in-process regex indent detection.
- **`completion-gate.sh` crash**: `packages/quality-gates/hooks/_lib` symlink to root `hooks/_lib` was missing. Fix: created symlink. Follow-up: audit other `packages/*/hooks/` for same bug.
- **Project registry pollution**: 241 stale pytest fixture entries in `~/.cognitive-os/installations.json` (251 → 10 real projects). Root cause: `tests/integration/test_install_scope.py` didn't set `COS_REGISTRY_FILE`. Fix: env var in tests + `PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST` guard in `cos_registry_register` as belt-and-suspenders.
- **engram roundtrip test**: failed after upgrade to v1.13.1. Root cause: macOS Operon sandbox SIGKILL'd `~/go/bin/engram` spawned from Claude Code. Fix: `_resolve_engram_bin()` prefers `~/.local/bin/engram` (has Gatekeeper allow-list) over `~/go/bin/engram`.
- `cos-bootstrap.sh --profile full` — was silent no-op for nemo/jupyter/cognee. Now passes the three profile flags.
- 15 unit perf test failures root-caused (not marked flaky). Result: 7155 pass / 0 fail.
- Empty-stdin fast-exit budget: 200ms → 500ms (documented with rationale).
- `observability-trace.sh` orphan symlink (post-ADR-058 cleanup).
- `test_profiled_services` post-Opik removal (ADR-060).
- `test_rules_enforcement`: registered 6 previously hook-enforced-BROKEN rules (audit-trail, auto-rollback, confidence-gate, confidentiality-protection, agent-identity, pre-dev-readiness-gate, reinvention-prevention).

### Documentation

- `docs/adrs/ADR-059-existential-validation.md` — 3-phase plan (prune humo / install-timing / core-extensions split).
- `docs/patterns/cross-harness-authoring.md` — self-check protocol for SO-path changes.
- Package migration plan — 10 integrations mapped to future `cos` packages.
- Plugin marketplace design — `cos install` with 6-gate security audit pipeline.
- `install.sh` dual-mode installer (local source auto-detection + `--from` flag).
- Tech radar update — 26 Claude Code ecosystem tools analyzed (7 ADOPT, 19 WATCH, 5 BLOCK).
- Multi-tool architecture — adapter layer for OpenCode, Aider, Cursor support (foundation for ADR-064).
- 7 ecosystem integrations documented (agnix, claude-code-action, parry, Trail of Bits, recall, Usage Monitor, hcom).
- 19 WATCH repos deep-analyzed — 22 extractable patterns prioritized (P0-P3).

## [0.15.0] - 2026-04-21 — "ADR-047 Phase A + Decision Depth Gate"

> Note: VERSION file was stale at 0.9.0 when this release was cut, but
> tags v0.10.0 through v0.14.2 already existed remotely (patch releases
> not documented in this CHANGELOG). Bumped to 0.15.0 as next available.
> This is the first documented release since 0.12.0; intervening patches
> exist as tags only.

### Added — ADR-047 Session Lifecycle Management (Phase A shipped)

- `scripts/so-session-watchdog.py` — Phase A log-only daemon. Classifies sessions (HEALTHY / IDLE_OVER_TTL / ORPHANED / RESUMED_RECENTLY), writes `session-watchdog.jsonl`. NEVER kills.
- `lib/session_watchdog_lib.py` — layered Phase B liveness predicate: `should_kill() = parent_dead OR (ttl_exceeded AND heartbeat_stale AND metric_writes_stale AND cpu_idle_sustained)`. 4 checks, each tested independently.
- `hooks/session-heartbeat.sh` — PRIMARY liveness signal. Fires on `UserPromptSubmit` + `PreToolUse` wildcard. Atomic epoch write to `.cognitive-os/sessions/{id}/heartbeat`. Distinct from `state-heartbeat.sh` (crash recovery) and `agent_bus_metrics` (sub-agent watchdog).
- `hooks/session-watchdog-launcher.sh` — SessionStart singleton launcher (mirrors reaper-daemon-launcher pattern). mkdir-lock + pidfile guard with cmdline verification. Respects `COS_SESSION_WATCHDOG_DISABLE=1` opt-out.
- 39 new unit tests + 12 E2E smoke tests (zero daemon leaks verified).

### Added — Decision Depth Gate

- `rules/decision-depth-gate.md` — Q1-Q4 coherence analysis mandatory before closing "two values inconsistent" findings. Caught a real threshold bug (Phase A 1.0% vs Phase B 5.0% CPU — Phase A was under-predicting Phase B kills).
- `skills/invariant-check/` — scans ADR+lib pairs, emits pytest assertions for proposed invariants. On ADR-047 produces 7 invariants.
- `hooks/surface-fix-detector.sh` — PostToolUse advisory. Detects ~100% additive diffs with clarify/note trigger words.
- Cross-phase invariant test: Phase A threshold ≥ Phase B threshold (enforced in CI).

### Added — cos-config-audit validator

- `scripts/cos-config-audit.sh` — reports each cognitive-os.yaml section as IMPL / PARTIAL / ASPIR by checking agentic primitive wiring. Data-driven CONTRACTS list.
- `# STATUS:` annotations on 9 cognitive-os.yaml sections (indent-aware parser).
- `--strict` flag — exits 1 on DRIFT (annotation vs runtime mismatch).
- `meta.settings_freshness` contract — detects `apply-efficiency-profile.sh` changes without settings regen.
- CI workflow `.github/workflows/cos-config-audit.yml` — weekly cron + PR-triggered + drift comment.
- Current snapshot: **8 IMPL / 0 PARTIAL / 2 ASPIR** (ttft_watchdog + engram_mcp intentionally Phase B scope).

### Added — Startup Protocol

- `rules/startup-protocol.md` + `hooks/session-startup-protocol.sh` — 5-step checklist (mem_search → plans↔ADRs → work-queue → validator → execute). Fires on SessionStart, 55ms, advisory only.

### Added — Cross-platform CI discipline

- `hooks/_lib/portable.sh` — BSD/GNU abstraction with Python3 fallback (date arithmetic, sed in-place, stat mtime, readlink, timeout, sha256).
- 17 hooks + scripts migrated off direct BSD-only invocations.
- `.github/workflows/cross-platform.yml` + `Dockerfile.ci-linux` — Linux CI smoke job prevents regressions.
- `scripts/shellcheck-baseline.txt` captures known-acceptable violations.

### Added — Startup baseline + ADR-044 Phase 2

- `scripts/startup-benchmark.sh` + SLO 10 (≤50k tokens core payload) and SLO 11 (TTFT p95 <5s) in `rules/so-slo.md`.
- ADR-044 Phase 2: 85 skills gained `summary_line` frontmatter (-270 tokens / -8% in `CATALOG-COMPACT.md`).
- 4 slash commands (`/engram-help`, `/sdd-help`, `/skills-search`, `/rules-expand`) for lazy-load on demand.

### Added — `cos-update` auto-regen + runtime daemons visibility

- `cos-update.sh` auto-regenerates `.claude/settings.json` when `apply-efficiency-profile.sh` changes (SHA-tracked at `.cognitive-os/state/apply-efficiency-profile.sha`). Mirrors `uv sync` pattern.
- `hooks/cognitive-os-health.sh` + `scripts/cos-status.sh` gain Daemons section (watchdog, reaper) with PID/uptime/cmdline-match verification.
- `hooks/context-watchdog.sh` REGISTERED (was an existing gap: rule said "NOT registered" — now fires on PostToolUse wildcard with 50/70/85% thresholds).

### Fixed

- 4 files with unresolved merge conflict markers: `hooks/self-install.sh`, `hooks/_lib/dispatch_gate_check.py`, `lib/agent_health_monitor.py`, `lib/dispatch_helper.py`. Resolved favoring "Stashed changes" side.
- `tests/unit/test_nemo_integration.py::test_skill_has_frontmatter` — tolerates leading `<!-- SCOPE: -->` comment (scope-governance convention).
- `tests/unit/test_repomix_integration.py::test_config_in_yaml` — tolerates documented section removal.
- Reconciliation: 20 plans in `.cognitive-os/plans/features/` mapped against ADRs. 11 SUPERSEDED / 4 LIVE / 3 STALE. Summary at `docs/architecture/plans-reconciliation-2026-04-21.md`.
- ADR-038 + ADR-039 published to canonical `docs/adrs/` (publication gap closed).
- ADR-003 duplicate deleted (wrong path). ADR-027a 4 PENDING items resolved. ADR-028a 6 PENDING items resolved (6 done, 2 deferred, 1 partial).
- work-queue.json rotated (44 completed entries to Engram, 3 stale parked removed).

### Metrics this release

- **22 commits** over one session.
- 6177 / 6209 tests pass (99.5%). 32 remaining failures are pre-existing (tracked in `docs/reports/pre-existing-test-failures-2026-04-21.md`).
- Engram observations added: 15+ under `adr-047/*`, `cos-config-audit/*`, `plans-reconciliation/*`, `decision-depth-gate/*`.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-04-20 — "SO Reliability Framework"

### Added — ADR-028 (full 6-pillar reliability framework)

- **D1.A Observability foundation**: `lib/metric_event.py` (canonical JSONL event schema with ENOSPC-safe `append_event` returning bool), `docs/reports/metrics-census.md` (F-1..F-8 surfaced), rotation by size (>1 MiB) + age (>7 d) in `hooks/metrics-rotation.sh`, archive path aligned.
- **D1.B Process registry + reaper**: `lib/process_registry.py` + `ProcessRegistry` facade (register/deregister/cleanup_expired/detect_orphans), `scripts/so-reaper.sh`, `hooks/session-end-reap.sh`. 8 real call sites via `hooks/_lib/register-bg.sh`. Safe-kill contract: only registered PIDs can be terminated.
- **D1.C Agent liveness (via agent_bus adapter, ADR-028b)**: `lib/agent_bus_metrics.py` bridges `cos:agent:*:heartbeat` events to MetricEvent JSONL. No parallel heartbeat system — builds on existing `lib/agent_bus.py`. Proven end-to-end with orchestrator smoke test (commit `ae84bb8`).
- **D1.D Unified dashboard**: `scripts/so-vitals.sh` (human + `--json` modes) aggregates agents, registered processes, orphan suspects, JSONL sizes, Valkey reachability. Consumed by chaos and contract tests.
- **D2 Contract test suite**: `tests/contracts/test_orphan_hooks.py` (130 hooks → 0 orphans), `test_fd_invariant.py`, `test_ram_ceiling.py`, `test_p95_hook_latency.py`. 4 real contracts, all behavioral.
- **D3 Systematic audit**: `docs/reports/hook-audit-2026-04.md` — 130 hooks scanned, 18 findings (2 BLOCKER, 9 CONCERN, 7 SUGGESTION) with anti-pattern taxonomy.
- **D4 Systematic fix**: 2/2 BLOCKERs + 9/9 CONCERNs resolved. `test-baseline-diff.sh` deleted (WS11 Bug-1 pattern). `mlflow-sync` + 5 other hooks wrapped in `timeout 30`. `rate-limit-protection.sh` reduced to deprecation shim of `token-budget-monitor.sh`.
- **D5 SLOs + runbook + killswitch**: `rules/so-slo.md` (9 SLOs + error budget), `docs/runbooks/so-incident-runbook.md`, `scripts/so-emergency-stop.sh`, `hooks/_lib/killswitch_check.sh` sourced by 124 of 129 hooks.
- **D6 Chaos suite**: `tests/chaos/` 5 scenarios (MCP kill, hook timeout, disk-full ENOSPC, FD exhaustion, git-reset cascade detector). All behavioral, 1 found a real gap and flipped to pass after D4 fix.

### Added — ADR-027 (SO slimming)

- **Phase 1**: `hooks/global-verify.sh` (PreToolUse/PostToolUse Agent, targeted test resolver + baseline/after diff), `lib/targeted_test_resolver.py` + `TargetedTestResolver` facade.
- **Phase 2**: `lib/ref_key_loader.py` — on-demand `[\`key\`]` → `rules/<key>.md` expansion with miss logging. Enables contextual rule inclusion.

### Added — ADR-029 (anti-reinvention gate)

- `hooks/reinvention-check.sh` wired at PreToolUse Agent. Grep-based similarity check against existing modules before sub-agent writes new file. Advisory in Phase A; hard-block at ≥0.7 similarity planned for Phase B.

### Added — Infrastructure

- `hooks/valkey-ensure.sh` auto-starts Valkey via OrbStack when `ORCHESTRATOR_MODE=executor`.
- `scripts/orchestrator.py` — dogfood entry point that uses `ClaudeExecutor` + `agent_bus_metrics` instead of the native Agent tool. Self-hosting loop proven (see `docs/reports/orchestrator-dogfood-smoke-test-2026-04-20.md`).
- 5 MetricEvent writer migrations (cost-events, consequence, skill-archive, telemetry, learning, singularity). 100% of cost-events rows migrated via `scripts/backfill-cost-events.py`.

### Changed

- `rules/RULES-COMPACT.md`: added `[\`so-slo\`]` ref-key on Infra line so ADR-028 SLO catalogue is loadable via the ref-key loader.
- `templates/agent-preamble.md`: 100 → 34 lines (trim). ~60% reduction in sub-agent context overhead (see `docs/reports/sub-agent-context-trim-2026-04-20.md`).
- `hooks/blast-radius.sh`: CRITICAL now requires `(INFRA AND SECURITY) OR file_score > 100` (was: `INFRA OR SECURITY OR file_score > 50`). Message compressed to one line.
- `hooks/inject-phase-context.sh`: gotchas dedup per session (first agent gets full text, subsequent get pointer).
- `hooks/_lib/task_panel_adapter.py`: skip tasks already in native Task panel (no more duplicate blocks).
- `lib/rate_limit_protection.py` → renamed to `lib/token_budget_monitor.py` (name collision with rate-limiter killed).

### Removed

- `lib/task_dag.py`, `lib/pipeline_executor.py`, `lib/workload_scheduler.py` — 65KB of dead code (`workflow-engine`), zero production callers.
- `hooks/test-baseline-diff.sh` — WS11 Bug-1 pattern (unbounded pytest at Stop).
- `lib/rate_limit_protection.py` + `hooks/rate-limit-protection.sh` reduced to deprecation shims.
- `valkey>=5.0` from `pyproject.toml` (redundant; `redis>=5.0.0` speaks the Valkey wire protocol).

### Fixed

- **F-4 SESSION_ID propagation**: `hooks/session-init.sh` now explicitly `export`s `COGNITIVE_OS_SESSION_ID` so 7 previously-invisible JSONL files (error-learning, repair-outcomes, remediation-registry, repair-queue, repair-dispatch, session-audit, singularity-events) can be written.
- **Singularity path**: `lib/singularity.py` `_SINGULARITY_LOG` was pointing to a dead `metrics/` directory; now writes to `.cognitive-os/metrics/`.
- **Hook registration sweep (debt register P1)**: `audit-id-enricher`, `auto-rollback-trigger`, `confidence-gate`, `confidentiality-enforcer`, `predev-completeness-check` registered (were on disk but never fired).
- **`metric_event.append_event` ENOSPC**: now returns `False` instead of raising, preventing cascading failures under disk pressure. `tests/chaos/test_disk_full_metrics.py` flipped from xfail to pass.
- **`scripts/so-vitals.sh` `cwd` bug**: `sys.path.insert(0, ".")` replaced with `"$PROJECT_DIR"` so the script works when invoked from outside the repo root.

### Documentation

- 4 new ADRs: `ADR-027a`, `ADR-028a`, `ADR-028b`, `ADR-029`.
- 9 audit / report documents under `docs/reports/` (metrics census, hook audit, debt register, artifact verification, reconciliation audit, smoke test, context trim, D1B TODO, validation).

### Dependencies

- `pyproject.toml` version bumped from `0.8.4` (stale — had not tracked releases since April 10) to `0.12.0` (aligned with tag).

## [Unreleased — superseded by 0.12.0] — UX1 + UX8 installer overhaul (ADR-002)

### Changed

- **BREAKING CHANGE (ADR-002)**: collapsed the 3-tier install profile system
  (`--lean` / `--standard` / `--full`) to 2 tiers:
  - `default` (no flag): 10 curated core skills + ~29 standard hooks + 14 core
    rules (~8000 tokens/session). Installed out of the box with no flag — the
    vanilla DX matches `git`, `gh`, and `claude`.
  - `--full`: every skill, hook, and rule (~142000 tokens/session). For mature
    projects and COS contributors.
- Legacy flags (`--lean`, `--standard`, `--minimal`) are now silently remapped
  to `default` with a stderr migration note — existing deployments continue to
  work without manual intervention.
- `install.sh`: new flag surface (`--full`, `--profile=NAME`, `--from`,
  `--force`, `--help`) with explicit ENV override (`COS_PROFILE`). Auto-detection
  removed; default is always `default`. Post-install summary now reports the
  number of skills exposed under `.claude/skills/` and warns on zero.
- `scripts/cos-init.sh`: accepts `--default` and `--full`; legacy flags
  silently map to `--default`. Skill install no longer gated behind non-minimal
  (both tiers ship skills). `DEFAULT_SKILLS` lists the 10 curated entries.
- `scripts/apply-efficiency-profile.sh`: 2-tier profile builder. The default
  tier now explicitly registers `auto-verify.sh`, `auto-refine.sh`,
  `dod-gate.sh`, `session-sanity.sh`, and `confidentiality-enforcer.sh`
  (PostToolUse Edit|Write) — the last fixes a regression where the enforcer
  had been dropped from the generated settings.
- `scripts/auto-update-projects.sh`: normalizes legacy registry `mode` values
  (`lean`, `standard`, `minimal`) to `default` before re-running `cos-init.sh`,
  so projects upgrade automatically on the next cascade.
- `scripts/generate-project-settings.sh`: `--default` is the canonical flag;
  legacy flags silently alias. `DEFAULT_HOOKS` now contains
  `confidentiality-enforcer.sh` and `session-sanity.sh`.
- `cognitive-os.yaml`: `efficiency.profile: default` and the `profiles:` map
  now defines only `default` and `full`.
- `docs/usage/cos-status.md`: references updated to the 2-tier model.

### Migration

Users who previously ran `install.sh --lean` or `install.sh --standard` should
drop the flag. The new `default` tier is a strict superset of the old `lean`
tier and the same hook set as the old `standard` tier plus 10 curated skills.
See `docs/architecture/harness-adoption-gap/ADR-002-simplify-profiles.md`.

- fix: Bifrost disabled in config to match docker-compose (ADR-011 superseded by ADR-018)
- fix: Removed 179 dead SCOPE/scope tags from 84 hooks + 95 libs (no code reads them)

### Removed

- 67 structural-only test files (false coverage) — tests/smoke/ deleted entirely
- 2,317 lines of structural tests pruned from 33 mixed behavior files
- 3 phantom skill entries from CATALOG.md (skills with no SKILL.md)

- 50+ commits in the 2-session stabilization effort

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- feat: Task DAG runner — declarative dependency graph for multi-agent workflows (lib/task_dag.py, 27 tests)
- feat: Agent health monitor — file-based dead/stuck agent detection without Valkey (lib/agent_health_monitor.py, 34 tests)
- feat: Queue drain on completion — blocked agents auto-enqueue and launch when slots free (lib/queue_drainer.py, 18 tests)
- feat: CronCreate scheduled drain — periodic 5-min fallback for stuck queues (lib/scheduled_drain.py, 15 tests)
- feat: Auto-repair with worktree isolation — fixes applied in isolated git worktree, verify, merge or discard (20 tests)
- feat: Auto-rewrite on skill failure — 3+ failures triggers /optimize-skill suggestion (9 tests)
- feat: Escalation detection wired — agents emit ESCALATION: markers, completion-gate detects (20 tests)
- feat: PromptBuilder — integrates context_diet + prompt_cache for token-efficient agent prompts (36 tests)
- feat: Dynamic model routing — DEGRADE/PROMOTE feed into model selection, budget-aware downgrade (16 tests)
- feat: E2E self-repair smoke test — 5 scenarios proving full feedback loop works (29 tests)
- feat: Closed-loop consequence tests — DEGRADE/PROMOTE/DISABLE validated end-to-end (22 tests)
- feat: cos-bootstrap.sh — one-command project setup (env, Docker, Langfuse, rules sync) (16 tests)
- feat: cos-update.sh — idempotent update for existing installations
- feat: scripts/test-all.sh — unified test runner with pytest-xdist parallel execution
- feat: Claude HUD — real-time statusline showing context %, costs, agents (ADOPT, MIT)
- feat: Langfuse v3 integration — traces + scores via OTEL API, auto-provisioned API keys
- feat: scripts/setup-langfuse.sh — fully automated Langfuse key provisioning (no manual steps)
- docs: self-repair-guide.md — user guide explaining what developers will experience
- docs: getting-started.md — updated with bootstrap, test runner, self-repair sections

### Fixed
- fix: agent preamble injection — sub-agents now emit TRUST_REPORT (was missing, cascade root cause)
- fix: cost tracking $0.00 — tool_response parsed as string, model-aware pricing (was always zero)
- fix: detect_success false positive — "0 failed" in Trust Report matched FAIL pattern
- fix: SeaweedFS healthcheck — localhost→127.0.0.1 (IPv6 resolution bug in Alpine)
- fix: integration test timeout — 30s→300s for testcontainers (was killing Docker fixtures)
- fix: hardcoded project path in test_e2e_flows.py — now uses Path(__file__).parents[2]
- fix: record_completion.py Langfuse API updated to v3 (OTEL-based spans + generations)
- fix: consequence-history.jsonl cleaned — 83% test data removed (600→102 real entries)

### Wired (hooks connected to settings.json)
- error-learning.sh (PostToolUse/Bash) — captures test/lint/build failures
- consequence-evaluator.sh (PostToolUse/Agent) — PROMOTE/DEGRADE/DISABLE decisions
- pre-compaction-flush.sh (PreCompact) — saves state before context reset
- resource-check.sh (PreToolUse/Agent) — budget enforcement blocks over-spend
- confidence-gate.sh (PostToolUse/Agent) — blocks low-confidence results in production

### Changed
- requirements.txt: langfuse>=3.0, pytest-xdist>=3.5 added
- rules/RULES-COMPACT.md: added skill-rewrite and task-dag references
- templates/agent-preamble.md: full escalation protocol with 5 signal types

## [0.8.4] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- feat: security-tools-landscape.md — implementation status tracking for P1/P2 security tools
- feat: tero-testing and mantis-security packages with cos-package.yaml manifests
- feat: workflow YAML files (feature-pipeline.yaml, bugfix-pipeline.yaml) in .cognitive-os/workflows/
- fix: pre-commit hook Gate 3e made advisory (warn, not block) on malformed workflow YAML
- fix: pre-commit hook gate labels standardized (Gate 3a–3e) for consistent detection
- fix: docs/INDEX.md version updated to v0.8.4
