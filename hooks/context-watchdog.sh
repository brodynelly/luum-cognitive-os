# SCOPE: both
# Context Watchdog — estimates context usage and warns at thresholds
# Type: PostToolUse
# Matcher: (none — fires on ALL tools)
#
# Logic:
#   - Counts tool calls in .cognitive-os/sessions/current/tool-call-count
#   - ~750 tokens per tool call average, 200K usable context
#   - 130 calls (~50%): log INFO to metrics only (silent)
#   - 185 calls (~70%): WARNING to stderr — save to engram now
#   - 225 calls (~85%): URGENT to stderr — split session
#
# Must be fast (<50ms) and always exits 0.
