"""Tests for lib/research_quality_advisor.py (ADR-175).

Three guarantees verified against the 2026-05-05 audit reports:

(a) The 3 sonnet audits score lower than the 3 opus audits.
(b) The user-driven rebuttal scores >= 60.
(c) Asymmetric-row detection catches the "Command Groups was asserted
    without verification" pattern (one-sided file:line).

This ADR governance review evaluates policy, boundary, risk, consequence, and alternative fit.

|---|---|---|---|
| Boundary | docs/adrs/ADR-170-operator-cli-as-primary-ui-surface.md:1-40 defines the prior UI decision | docs/adrs/ADR-172-multi-surface-ui-architecture.md:1-70 changes the accepted positioning | Confidence: HIGH |

## Verdict

Confidence: HIGH. The recommendation is to keep this as a governance decision, not a mechanical implementation audit.

## Alternatives rejected

- Treating this as a grep-only implementation check would miss decision intent.
- Creating ADR 999 immediately would increase scope creep.

## Uncertainties

- The policy may change if the release boundary changes.
- The numeric ADR references above are identifiers, not measured counts.
