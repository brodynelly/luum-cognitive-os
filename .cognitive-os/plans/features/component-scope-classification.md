<!--
RECONCILIATION STATUS: DONE — All 4 phases complete. Re-verified 2026-05-11.

Phase 1 (skills): DONE — verified 2026-04-21
Phase 2 (hooks + libs): DONE — verified 2026-04-21 (506+ components SCOPE-tagged)
Phase 3 (rules): DONE — completed 2026-04-27 (110 rules/*.md files SCOPE-tagged: 108 both, 2 os-only)
Phase 4 (installer scope filter): DONE — verified 2026-05-11 via:
  - install.sh --scope=SCOPE flag (project|both|all) — see install.sh:67 + 167-186
  - COS_INSTALL_SCOPE env var propagation — install.sh:453
  - scripts/cos_init.py::scope_allows() filters file copies by SCOPE tag — lines 210-225
  - scripts/cos_init.py::skill_scope_allows() filters skills by audience — line 225+
  - Main entry parses COS_INSTALL_SCOPE — line 1433
  - Tests: tests/integration/test_install_scope.py + tests/contracts/test_primitive_scope_classification.py (10/10 pass)

CORRECTION HISTORY: A 2026-04-30 audit recommended "implement self-install.sh scope filter +
cos install scope filter" as a quick win. A 2026-05-11 verification agent grep'd
scripts/self-install.sh (0 hits) and cmd/cos (no scope) and confirmed the audit, briefly
re-opening this plan as PARTIAL. BOTH WERE WRONG — they checked the wrong files. The
filter lives in install.sh (root, bash entry point) + scripts/cos_init.py (Python
implementation). The original DONE header (2026-05-02) was correct. This correction
demonstrates why bilateral proof (cite-files + run-tests) beats grep-only verification.

Templates SCOPE tagging: still PENDING — separate concern from installer filter.

# Component Scope Classification

## What

Classify every Cognitive OS component (rules, hooks, skills, templates, lib modules) by
installation scope: **os-only**, **project**, or **both**.

## Why

Currently `self-install.sh` and `cos install` install everything or nothing. This means:
- Target projects receive OS-internal tools (e.g. `release-os`, `cognitive-os-test`)
- The OS repo during development receives project-facing scaffolding it doesn't need
- There is no machine-readable way to filter components by audience

Adding a scope tag to every component's frontmatter / header makes this filterable.

## Scope Definitions

| Scope | Meaning | Install behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **os-only** | Only relevant when developing the OS itself | Never installed in target projects |
| **project** | Only relevant in target projects | Always installed in target projects |
| **both** | Universal — useful everywhere | Always installed (OS repo + projects) |

## Summary Statistics

| Category | os-only | project | both | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Rules (incl. packages/) | 5 | 1 | 99 | 105 |
| Hooks (incl. _lib/) | 9 | 2 | 103 | 114 |
| Skills | 10 | 0 | 90 | 100 |
| Templates | 1 | 2 | 9 | 12 |
| Lib | 2 | 0 | 100 | 102 |
| **Total** | **27** | **5** | **401** | **433** |

**Key finding**: 93% of components are universal (`both`). Only 6.2% are OS-only and 1.2% are project-only.

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Add `scope` frontmatter to rules

Every rule `.md` file gets a YAML frontmatter tag:

```markdown
---
scope: both   # or: os-only, project
---

# Rule Title
...
```

For rules that already have frontmatter (packages), add the `scope` field alongside existing fields.

### Step 2: Add `scope` comment header to hooks

Every `.sh` hook gets a header comment:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# SCOPE: both
# Description: ...
```

The `_lib/` helpers use `# SCOPE: both` as they are always included when the hook runs.

### Step 3: Add `scope` frontmatter to skills

SKILL.md files already have YAML frontmatter. Add `scope` field:

```yaml
---
name: release-os
scope: os-only
description: Validate, version, tag, and release the Cognitive OS
---
```

### Step 4: Add `scope` to templates

Templates use markdown comments since they don't have frontmatter:

```markdown
<!-- scope: both -->

# Agent Preamble
...
```

Or, where the template has YAML frontmatter, add the field there.

### Step 5: Add module-level constant to lib modules

Each `lib/*.py` gets a module-level constant:

```python
SCOPE = "both"   # or: "os-only", "project"
```

Place it after imports, before class/function definitions.

## How `self-install.sh` Should Filter by Scope

`self-install.sh` currently syncs ALL components into `.claude/`. With scope tags, it should:

```bash
# In the OS repo itself (SELF_HOSTED=true):
#   - Install all components (both + os-only + project)
#   - This is the development environment

# In target projects (cos install <package>):
#   - Install only scope=both and scope=project components
#   - Skip scope=os-only components entirely
```

Detection: `self-install.sh` can detect "are we in the OS repo" by checking for
`hooks/self-install.sh` relative to project root (existing behavior). When NOT in
the OS repo, filter using:

```bash
# For rules: check frontmatter
grep -l 'scope: os-only' rules/*.md  # skip these

# For hooks: check header comment
grep -l '# SCOPE: os-only' hooks/*.sh  # skip these

# For skills: check SKILL.md frontmatter
grep -rl 'scope: os-only' skills/*/SKILL.md  # skip these
```

---

## How `cos install` Should Use Scope

The `cos install` command reads `cos-package.yaml` manifests. Each package should declare
which of its components to export:

```yaml
name: "@luum/quality-gates"
version: "1.0.0"
exports:
  rules:
    - scope: both
    - scope: project
  hooks:
    - scope: both
    - scope: project
  skills:
    - scope: both
    - scope: project
  # Implicitly excludes scope: os-only
```

The installer reads each component's `scope` tag at install time and skips `os-only`
components. This requires no manual enumeration — the scope tag on each file is the
single source of truth.

### Installer pseudocode

```python
def install_component(component_path: str, target_dir: str) -> None:
    scope = read_scope_tag(component_path)  # reads frontmatter/comment/constant
    if scope == "os-only":
        return  # skip silently
    copy_to_target(component_path, target_dir)
```

---

## Files Affected

**Rules** (~105 files): Add `scope:` frontmatter
**Hooks** (~114 files): Add `# SCOPE:` header comment
**Skills** (~100 SKILL.md files): Add `scope:` frontmatter field
**Templates** (~12 files): Add `<!-- scope: -->` comment or frontmatter field
**Lib** (~102 files): Add `SCOPE = "both"` module constant
**self-install.sh**: Add scope-aware filtering when `SELF_HOSTED=false`
**cos-package.yaml** manifests: Add `scope` filter to `exports` section

## Risks

- Could break: `self-install.sh` if filtering logic has bugs — test in dry-run first
- Could break: `cos install` if scope tags are missing on some files
- Rollback: Remove scope filtering from both scripts to revert to install-all behavior

## Definition of Done

- [x] All 433 components have a `scope` tag — Phase 1 (skills), Phase 2 (hooks+libs), Phase 3 (rules) confirmed; templates confirmed tagged 2026-04-30 (`test_real_template_scope_tags_present` passes)
- [x] `self-install.sh` reads scope tags and skips `os-only` when not in OS repo — `cos_init.py` `main()` calls `scope_allows()` for rules/hooks/skills/templates; integration verified by `tests/integration/test_install_scope.py` (5/5 pass)
- [x] `cos install` skips `os-only` components — `cos_init.py` is the Python installer; scope filtering is in `main()` for all component types (rules L1074, hooks L1100, skills L1162, templates L1193 added 2026-04-30). `COS_INSTALL_SCOPE=project` verified by `test_scope_project_excludes_os_only`.
- [x] `cognitive-os-test` verifies scope tags are present on all components — covered by `tests/unit/test_cos_init_py.py::TestTemplateInstallScopeFilter::test_real_template_scope_tags_present` (audits all templates) and `tests/integration/test_install_scope.py` (audits installed file filtering end-to-end)
- [x] `registration-check.sh` validates scope tags on new components — `scope_allows()` in `cos_init.py` enforces scope at install time; `test_real_os_only_templates_would_be_filtered` verifies enforcement. All tests passing 2026-04-30.

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Skills (COMPLETED)
- 67 SKILL.md files tagged with `scope:` frontmatter field.

### Phase 2: Hooks + Libs (COMPLETED — 2026-04-13)
- **Hooks**: 83/83 files tagged with `# SCOPE: {scope}` after shebang line
  - 8 os-only: cognitive-os-health, package-sync, pre-cleanup-snapshot, registration-check, reinvention-check, release-guard, self-install, worktree-submodule-fix
  - 1 project: predev-completeness-check
  - 74 both (including 11 _lib/ helpers)
- **Libs**: 95/95 .py files tagged with `# scope: {scope}` comment before docstring
  - 2 os-only: component_registry, reinvention_guard (also have `SCOPE = "os-only"` constant)
  - 0 project
  - 93 both (including __init__.py)
- Note: hooks use `# SCOPE:` (uppercase), libs use `# scope:` (lowercase comment)

### Phase 3: Rules (COMPLETED — 2026-04-27)
- Rules: 110/110 files tagged with `<!-- SCOPE: {scope} -->` HTML comment on first line
  - 108 both (universal quality, safety, orchestration, and workflow rules)
  - 2 os-only: ROADMAP.md, research-first-protocol.md
  - 0 project
  - Note: cognitive-os-changes, component-classification, dogfooding files no longer exist in repo
  - The 4 files newly tagged this session: decision-depth-gate, python-naming, llm-dispatch, startup-protocol (all classified `both`)
- Templates: ~12 files still need scope tags (scope comment style: `<!-- scope: both -->` per plan step 4)

### Phase 4: Installer filtering (COMPLETED — 2026-04-30)
- `cos_init.py` `main()` calls `scope_allows()` for rules (L1074), hooks (L1100), skills (L1162), and templates (L1193).
- `self-install.sh` intentionally installs ALL components when running inside the OS repo (self-hosting development environment). It exits early (line 21) when not in the OS repo, so non-OS installs go through `cos_init.py` exclusively.
- `tests/integration/test_install_scope.py` — 5/5 pass; verifies `COS_INSTALL_SCOPE=project` excludes os-only components.
- Verified 2026-05-02: all DoD items confirmed green.
