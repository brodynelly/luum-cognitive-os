# ADR-273: Pending Truth Ledger and Bilateral Verification Loop

## Status
Accepted — Slices A + B implemented; Slice C designed and staged (deployment requires operator authorization via `COS_ALLOW_PROTECTED_CONFIG_WRITE=1` per `hooks/protected-config-write-guard.sh`).

Implementation status by slice (2026-05-12):
- **Slice A** ✅ schema (manifests/pending-truth.yaml) + aggregator (scripts/cos-pending-truth-aggregator) + 6/6 portability tests pass
- **Slice B** ✅ verifier (scripts/cos-pending-truth-verify) + 5/5 portability tests pass. First run on 279 items: 7 verified-done, 267 verified-pending, 2 obsolete, 3 ambiguous. Deterministic baseline (Opus LLM verification still useful for semantic depth)
- **Slice C** 🟡 designed + staged at docs/runbooks/adr-273-slice-c-staging/. Three hook scripts written + smoke-tested. Activation pending operator deployment (protected-config-write-guard blocks agent-side hooks/ writes)

<!-- SCOPE: OS -->

**Date**: 2026-05-12

## Context

The 2026-05-12 bilateral verification pass surfaced a systemic drift problem
in COS pending-work tracking. Today's data point:

- **9 different surfaces** independently claim to track "what is pending":
  plan checkboxes, ADR status frontmatter, `master-pending-*.md` snapshots,
  `radar-2026-05-08-implementation-tracker.md`, `cos_session_backlog.py`
  output, `aspirational-audit.py`, `acc_pipeline.py`, `cos-control-plane-audit`,
  `feature-reality-matrix`.
- **None is a verified source of truth**. Three Opus agents working in
  parallel found that **25% of the project's 283 OPEN plan checkboxes are
  actually shipped** but the plan was never updated. Additionally **7% are
  obsolete** (context no longer applies) and **16% are ambiguous**. Only
  **~52% are truly pending**.
- The same drift pattern was discovered 2026-05-11 on a single plan
  (`component-scope-classification.md` Phase 4 reported PENDING but actually
  shipped). Today's pass proves the pattern is project-wide, not local.

**Root cause**: plan checkboxes and ADR statuses are **manually maintained
by the author at write time**. When code lands that closes a plan item,
nothing forces the plan to update. Every "is X done?" query requires fresh
bilateral verification, and the existing primitives don't aggregate or
auto-verify.

**Existing primitives that should solve this but don't**:
- `plan-claim-validator.sh` — enforces `(verified: ...)` proofs **on edit**;
  does nothing when code lands without touching the plan.
- `cos_session_backlog.py` — aggregates surfaces but does not verify;
  currently broken under Python 3.14.
- `cos-control-plane-audit` (ADR-248) — runs manifest-declared regression
  audits, but no manifest yet covers plan items.
- `aspirational-audit.py`, `acc_pipeline.py`, `feature-reality-matrix` —
  each covers a slice (primitives, capabilities, feature claims) but not
  plan items or follow-ups.

## Decision

Introduce a single canonical pending-truth ledger with bilateral verification:

### 1. Canonical schema (`manifests/pending-truth.yaml`)

Every actionable pending item carries:

```yaml
schema_version: pending-truth/v1
items:
  - id: plan:adr-064:slice-1-1            # stable composite id
    type: plan-checkbox                    # plan-checkbox|adr-slice|follow-up|user-request|audit-finding
    source: .cognitive-os/plans/architecture/adr-064-implementation-plan.md:L42
    status: verified-pending               # verified-pending|verified-done|ambiguous|obsolete|unverified
    last_verified: 2026-05-12T14:30Z
    evidence:
      - {kind: file_exists, path: lib/codex_adapter.py, result: missing}
      - {kind: test_passes, cmd: "pytest tests/unit/test_codex_adapter.py", result: not_found}
    next_action: implement codex adapter
    owner_adr: ADR-064
    effort_estimate: 1 session
```

### 2. Aggregator (`scripts/cos-pending-truth-aggregator`)

Read-only walk of all surfaces, emit normalized items to
`manifests/pending-truth.yaml` + `docs/reports/pending-truth-latest.{json,md}`.

Sources scanned in v1:
- `.cognitive-os/plans/{features,architecture,roadmaps}/*.md` — every `- [ ]`
  checkbox becomes a `plan-checkbox` item
- `docs/adrs/ADR-*.md` — every ADR with `status: proposed|draft|in-progress`
  becomes an `adr-slice` item
- `docs/reports/radar-2026-05-08-implementation-tracker.md` — every 🔲 or 🟡
  row becomes a `follow-up` item
- `.cognitive-os/sessions/*/user-requests.jsonl` — every `status: pending`
  becomes a `user-request` item
- `.cognitive-os/tasks/active-tasks.json` — every non-cancelled becomes
  `audit-finding`

### 3. Verifier (`scripts/cos-pending-truth-verify`) — Slice B (not implemented in this ADR)

For each item, runs the declared `evidence` checks (grep / file existence /
test execution / ADR cross-reference), updates `status` + `last_verified`,
and emits drift diff. This is the automation of what the 3 Opus agents did
manually on 2026-05-12.

### 4. Hooks (Slice C, not implemented in this ADR)

- **PostToolUse Edit**: when a commit touches a library path and ≥1 ledger
  item declares matching evidence, suggest "should you mark item closed?"
- **Stop hook (weekly)**: re-run verifier on items with `last_verified > 7 days`.
- **PreCommit gate**: block merge-to-main if `pending-truth-latest.json` is
  stale > 30 days.

### 5. ADR-273 contract

- The 9 dispersed surfaces remain as **inputs** to the aggregator, NOT as
  competing sources of truth. The ledger replaces them as the canonical
  query target for "what is pending".
- Every new actionable item proposed by a plan, ADR, or report MUST appear
  in `manifests/pending-truth.yaml` within one aggregation cycle.
- The aggregator output (`docs/reports/pending-truth-latest.md`) is the
  ONE doc to read for pending-work questions in future sessions.

## Slice A scope (this ADR's commit)

Implements only:
- The schema definition (this ADR §1).
- `manifests/pending-truth.yaml` skeleton with 5 sample items demonstrating
  each `type` value.
- `scripts/cos-pending-truth-aggregator` — read-only walk of the 5 sources
  above, emits `docs/reports/pending-truth-latest.{json,md}`.
- Portability test at `tests/red_team/portability/test_cos-pending-truth-aggregator.py`.

Slices B (verifier) and C (hooks) are tracked as follow-ups; this ADR
declares the schema is stable so they can build on it.

## Operational Guide (how to think about and use this ledger)

This section is the practical guide future-you (or any reader without
conversation context) needs to actually USE the ledger.

### What changes for the operator

**The 9 source surfaces NEVER change.** Plans, ADRs, tracker, master-pending,
session-backlog, active-tasks, user-requests, aspirational-audit,
acc_pipeline — all keep their narrative/architectural roles:

- **Plans** explain the WHY of work (sprint context, dependencies, design)
- **ADRs** are architectural memory (why we decided X this way)
- **Tracker** orders by wave/sprint
- **Master-pending** is snapshot semantic (point-in-time photograph)
- **Aspirational-audit** is metric-driven (dormant ratio, etc.)
- **Etc.**

These are CONTEXT. The ledger is OPERATIONAL.

### What the ledger answers (and the surfaces don't)

| Question | Before (any of 9 surfaces) | After (the ledger) |
|---|---|---|
| "How many pending items exist in COS?" | 9 different answers (283 / 17 / 0 / 67 …) — none verified | **1 answer** from `docs/reports/pending-truth-latest.md` |
| "Why is X pending?" | grep across 9 places | ledger item has `source: <path>:<line>` — go there |
| "Is X actually still pending, or already shipped?" | dispatch 3 Opus agents (~$5, 45min) | Slice B `cos-pending-truth-verify` will check evidence; today: read `status: unverified` and run verifier |
| "When did someone last check?" | unknown | `last_verified` timestamp per item |
| "Did someone ship code that closed plan item Y?" | manual audit | Slice C hook will detect on PostToolUse Edit |

### Daily operational pattern (after ADR-273 Slice A)

1. **At session start**, before assuming you know what's pending:
   ```bash
   scripts/cos-pending-truth-aggregator --write
   ```
   This refreshes `docs/reports/pending-truth-latest.{json,md}` from the
   current state of all 9 input surfaces. Read the .md.

2. **When picking next work**, search the ledger for items with specific
   `type` or low `last_verified` age:
   ```bash
   python3 -c "import json; d=json.load(open('docs/reports/pending-truth-latest.json'));
   [print(i['id'], i['next_action'][:80]) for i in d['items'] if i['type'] == 'follow-up']"
   ```

3. **When you ship code that closes a plan item**, until Slice C lands you
   must STILL manually update the plan checkbox `[x]` AND ideally add
   `(verified: commit-SHA file-path)`. The ledger will pick that up on
   next aggregation.

4. **Periodically (weekly)** until Slice B lands: re-dispatch the bilateral
   Opus verification we did 2026-05-12 to catch unmarked-done items.
   Pattern recorded in
   `docs/reports/checkbox-verification-batch-{A,B,C}-2026-05-12.md`.

### Why the surfaces are INPUTS, not REPLACEMENT TARGETS

Each surface has narrative content that the ledger does not preserve:

- A plan has a "Why" section explaining the context — the ledger only
  carries one-line `next_action`.
- An ADR has alternatives-rejected and consequences — the ledger only
  records `owner_adr` reference.
- The tracker has multi-wave timeline — the ledger has flat items.

**If you removed the surfaces and kept only the ledger, you would lose:**
sprint planning context (plans), decision rationale (ADRs), wave/sprint
ordering (tracker), episodic session context (session backlog).

**The ledger derives operational state; the surfaces preserve operational
narrative.** Both are required. The ledger is `SELECT * FROM all_pending_things`;
the surfaces are the underlying schema with relationships.

### Anti-confusion: when surfaces disagree

If a plan says `- [ ] item X` but the ledger marks it `verified-done`, the
ledger wins for the question "is X done?" The plan checkbox is stale and
should be updated (Slice C will automate this; until then, manual).

If a plan says `- [x] item Y` but the ledger lists it as `verified-pending`,
the plan is overclaiming. The plan checkbox should be reverted to `- [ ]`
until evidence exists.

**The bilateral-verification rule (per ADR-244 trust-score precedent)**:
when surface and code disagree, **code wins**. The ledger reflects code,
not paperwork.

### Reading guide for future readers without conversation context

If you are a future operator or agent and you encounter this ADR cold:

1. Read `docs/reports/pending-truth-latest.md` for the current operational
   state. The operational-guide preamble in that file is auto-rendered.
2. Read this ADR-273 §Decision for the schema and contract.
3. Read `docs/reports/historical-pending-analysis-2026-05-12.md` for the
   bilateral verification methodology that motivated this ADR.
4. Read `docs/reports/checkbox-verification-batch-{A,B,C}-2026-05-12.md`
   for the empirical evidence that 25% of OPEN checkboxes are mismarked.

The ledger is meaningful only because the bilateral verification (Opus
agents 2026-05-12) proved that raw checkbox counts are not trustworthy.
Slice B will encode this verification as a script; Slice C will prevent
new drift from accumulating.

## Consequences

- **One file to consult**: `docs/reports/pending-truth-latest.md` answers
  "what is pending" without re-running 3 Opus agents.
- **Drift becomes visible**: after Slice B lands, items whose evidence
  fails verification get re-classified; plans/ADRs that disagree become
  audit findings instead of silent staleness.
- **Anti-accumulation enforced**: after Slice C, new items without
  evidence-check declarations cannot be added.
- **Migration**: existing 9 surfaces stay; their format does not change.
  Only their role does — from "potential source of truth" to "input to
  aggregator".

## Alternatives rejected

- **Per-plan tracker tabs**: would not solve cross-surface drift; only
  pushes the problem from plans into plan-trackers.
- **Engram as ledger**: Engram works for episodic memory + semantic recall;
  it does not produce a deterministic verifier-friendly export.
- **External issue tracker (GitHub Issues)**: would require new
  permissions/auth surface; off-roadmap and violates local-first posture.
- **Eliminate 8 surfaces, keep only this ledger**: too aggressive — plans
  still serve operator narrative; ADRs serve architectural memory. The
  ledger is **derived**, not replacement.

## Verification

```bash
# Slice A acceptance (this commit)
python3 scripts/cos-pending-truth-aggregator --json > /tmp/pt.json
python3 -c "import json; d=json.load(open('/tmp/pt.json')); assert d['schema_version']=='pending-truth/v1'; assert len(d['items'])>0; print('items:', len(d['items']))"

# Portability proof
python3 -m pytest tests/red_team/portability/test_cos-pending-truth-aggregator.py -q

# Manifest schema valid
python3 -c "import yaml; d=yaml.safe_load(open('manifests/pending-truth.yaml')); assert d['schema_version']=='pending-truth/v1'"
```

## Follow-ups

- **Slice B** — `scripts/cos-pending-truth-verify` (bilateral evidence
  runner). Effort: 1 session. Tracked separately.
- **Slice C** — hook wiring (PostToolUse Edit + Stop weekly + PreCommit
  staleness gate). Effort: 1 session. Tracked separately.
- **Migration audits**: deprecate `master-pending-YYYY-MM-DD.md` cadence
  in favor of `pending-truth-latest.md` once Slice B lands.
