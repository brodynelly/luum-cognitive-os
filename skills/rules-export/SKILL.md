<!-- SCOPE: project -->
## Purpose

Adopting projects commit to a set of SO rules as their own standards.
This skill writes a consolidated markdown snapshot of those rules into
`docs/08-standards/rules-snapshot-<DATE>.md` so new contributors can
read the rules without needing direct access to the SO repo.

The snapshot is a point-in-time copy — the authoritative source stays
in the SO repo. Re-run `/rules-export` periodically to refresh.

## Invocation

```
/rules-export --project-dir <path>                  # default rule set
/rules-export --project-dir <path> --rules so-slo definition-of-done
```

The underlying CLI is `scripts/rules_export.py`, invoked via `uv run`.

## CLI

```bash
uv run python3 scripts/rules_export.py \
    --project-dir /path/to/adopting-project \
    [--rules so-slo definition-of-done credential-management] \
    [--so-root /path/to/cognitive-os-repo] \
    [--json]
```

### Default rule set

If `--rules` is not given, these rules are exported:

- `so-slo` — SLO catalogue (ADR-028)
- `definition-of-done` — DoD by complexity
- `credential-management` — secret handling
- `acceptance-criteria` — prompt criteria
- `responsiveness` — communication protocol
- `adversarial-review` — zero-findings halt

## Output

`docs/08-standards/rules-snapshot-<YYYY-MM-DD>-<HHMMSS>.md` with:

1. Header: export timestamp + SO git SHA (for traceability)
2. Table of contents (links to each rule section)
3. Each rule body, preceded by `## <name>` and a source-path note,
   separated by horizontal rules.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] File created under `<project>/docs/08-standards/`.
- [ ] File contains a ToC listing every rule passed in `--rules` (or
      the 6 defaults).
- [ ] Header notes the SO git SHA (or "unknown" when running outside a
      git checkout).
- [ ] CLI exits 0 on success, 1 on missing rule or missing `--project-dir`.

## Verification

```bash
# Smoke test in tmp dir
TMPDIR=$(mktemp -d)
uv run python3 scripts/rules_export.py --project-dir "$TMPDIR" --json
ls "$TMPDIR/docs/08-standards/"        # exactly one .md file
grep -q "Rules Snapshot" "$TMPDIR"/docs/08-standards/*.md
```

## Notes

- READ-ONLY against the SO repo — only writes to the adopting project.
- Does NOT modify the SO rules themselves.
- Writes are additive: each run produces a new timestamped file, so
  history is preserved. Prune manually when desired.
- For complete 10-category scaffold first, run `/project-scaffold` (ADR-054).
