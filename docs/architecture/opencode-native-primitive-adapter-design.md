# OpenCode Native Primitive Adapter Design

## Status

Implemented for the signed starter slice — `destructive-git-blocker`, `destructive-rm-blocker`, `large-file-advisor`, and `skill-router` are projected through `packages/opencode-adapter/plugins/cos-primitive-guard.js` and verified by `docs/reports/opencode-primitive-adapter-smoke-latest.md`. Other primitives remain `host-plugin-lifecycle-capable` until their own smoke is signed.

## Purpose

Close the ADR-256 / ADR-257 OpenCode gap without inventing a parallel COS-only
enforcement layer. The first runtime slice now uses the native OpenCode project
plugin surface documented by OpenCode: local project plugins under
`.opencode/plugins/` and `tool.execute.before` events. The smoke is model-free
and verifies plugin load, blocking behavior, and COS ledger emission.

## Design

```text
primitive contract
  -> capability mapping
  -> OpenCode permission rule
  -> OpenCode plugin tool.execute.before / tool.execute.after
  -> COS primitive-interventions.jsonl receipt
  -> projection fidelity report
```

## Capability mapping

| COS capability | OpenCode surface | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `inspect_shell_command` | plugin `tool.execute.before` for shell/bash tool input | Read command metadata only; do not persist raw command content in COS ledger. |
| `block_tool_call` | plugin pre-tool return/deny path plus OpenCode permission deny/ask | Blocking is claimable only after smoke proves the host stops the tool. |
| `warn` / `advise` | plugin message/metadata plus COS receipt | Advisory actions must not be labeled enforcement. |
| `emit_metric` | existing COS JSONL helper via plugin bridge | Best-effort; plugin failure must fail closed only for blocking primitives. |
| `emit_intervention` | `.cognitive-os/metrics/primitive-interventions.jsonl` | Required for comparable ADR-256 evidence. |
| read/write inspection | plugin pre/post tool metadata | Must not store file contents, grep patterns, or raw tool output. |

## Adapter artifacts

The future adapter implementation should generate or validate:

- `opencode.json` advisory/profile settings;
- OpenCode permission entries for coarse allow/ask/deny;
- `packages/opencode-adapter/plugins/cos-primitive-guard.js` as the canonical plugin source;
- `.opencode/plugins/cos-primitive-guard.js` projected into OpenCode consumer installs;
- `.cognitive-os/metrics/primitive-interventions.jsonl` rows;
- `docs/reports/opencode-primitive-adapter-smoke-latest.md`.

## Runtime smoke acceptance

A signed smoke must include all of the following before any primitive is promoted
from `host-plugin-lifecycle-capable` to enforced in OpenCode. The current signed
starter slice satisfies this for `destructive-git-blocker`,
`destructive-rm-blocker`, `large-file-advisor`, and `skill-router`:

1. OpenCode version and operating system.
2. Fixture repo path and disposable branch/worktree.
3. Primitive id and source contract.
4. Tool/action attempted.
5. Evidence that OpenCode prevented or allowed the tool as expected.
6. Matching `primitive-interventions.jsonl` row with `session_id`, `tool_use_id`,
   `primitive_id`, `action_kind`, and `reason_code`.
7. Proof that no raw command, file content, grep pattern, or secret was persisted.
8. Rollback path for disabling the plugin/permission projection.

## Non-goals

- Do not claim current OpenCode runtime enforcement from `opencode.json` alone.
- Do not replace OpenCode permissions/plugins with an unrelated COS wrapper before
  trying the native surface.
- Do not store private tool payloads in COS metrics.
- Do not promote all primitives at once; start with `destructive-git-blocker` and
  `destructive-rm-blocker`.

## Current fidelity

Current fidelity is split:

```text
OpenCode signed starter slice: governed-wrapper-enforced
OpenCode remaining primitives: host-plugin-lifecycle-capable
```

The signed starter slice is `governed-wrapper-enforced` because COS owns the
plugin bridge while OpenCode supplies the native project-plugin lifecycle event.
Do not promote additional primitives until their plugin behavior and ledger rows
are covered by smoke evidence.

## Current sources checked

- [OpenCode Plugins](https://opencode.ai/docs/plugins/) documents project-level `.opencode/plugins/` loading and `tool.execute.before` / `tool.execute.after` events.
- [OpenCode Permissions](https://opencode.ai/docs/permissions/) documents `permission` actions `allow`, `ask`, and `deny`.
