## Status

Accepted.

## Context

The most distinctive Hermes learning primitive is the *review agent*: after a
conversation turn, a second AIAgent fork runs silently in the background with
the full conversation history as context and a review prompt. The reviewer
identifies skill opportunities, memory updates, and other improvements, then
writes them directly to shared stores — without the user seeing any
intermediate output.

COS currently has passive signal collection:
- `feedback_detector.py`: classifies prompts post-hoc by category
- `feedback_consumer.py`: surfaces negative signals as skill-improvement inputs
- `hooks/skill-feedback-tracker.sh`: records per-invocation success/failure

What COS does NOT have is an **active audit agent** that reads a completed
sub-agent's output and asks "was this correct? did it hallucinate? should a
skill be updated?". The passive classifiers cannot answer these questions
because they do not evaluate agent *outputs*, only user *inputs*.

### Hermes `_spawn_background_review` — what it does

Source: `.claude/plugins/hermes-agent/run_agent.py`, lines 2749–2828.

```
1. A fork AIAgent is created with the same model, platform, and provider.
2. The fork shares _memory_store and _memory_enabled with the parent.
3. The review prompt (_MEMORY_REVIEW_PROMPT, _SKILL_REVIEW_PROMPT, or
   _COMBINED_REVIEW_PROMPT) is appended as the next user turn.
4. The fork runs conversation silently (stdout/stderr redirected to /dev/null).
5. After the fork completes, its _session_messages are scanned for successful
   tool results (memory saves, skill creates).
6. A compact summary ("💾 Memory updated · Skill updated") is printed to the
   parent's output.
```

The review runs in a `threading.Thread` (background, non-blocking).
`max_iterations=8` limits runaway review agents.

### What is portable from Hermes (MIT license)

| Hermes artifact | COS equivalent | Portability |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------|
| `_MEMORY_REVIEW_PROMPT` / `_SKILL_REVIEW_PROMPT` (prompt text, ~200 words each) | `lib/review_agent.py::build_review_prompt` | Adapted verbatim (Hermes tool references replaced with COS TRUST_REPORT conventions) |
| `max_iterations=8` cap on reviewer | Same cap via dispatch timeout | Pattern portable |
| Shared memory store between parent and reviewer | COS uses Engram (MCP); reviewer calls `mem_save` | Pattern portable, mechanism differs |
| `threading.Thread` for non-blocking review | v1: sync. v2 async follow-up | Pattern portable, mechanism deferred |

What is NOT portable:
- Hermes's `AIAgent` class (Hermes-internal; COS uses the Claude Code Agent)
- `_memory_store` shared-reference pattern (not applicable with MCP tools)
- Hermes's skill store at `~/.hermes/skills/` (COS skills are in-repo)

## Decision

### 1. Trigger: post-hoc async (Accepted)

Review fires AFTER the parent agent reports done. The parent task is never
blocked waiting for review. v2 now writes `.cognitive-os/runtime/review-pending-*.json`
markers and launches `scripts/review_pending_sweeper.py` in the background.
The legacy synchronous path remains available for diagnostics with
`review.async: false` or `COS_REVIEW_ASYNC=0`.

### 2. Sampling: 20% by default (Accepted)

Reviews fire for 20% of sub-agent outputs by default. Configurable via
`cognitive-os.yaml review.sample_rate: 0.2`. Always-review (`1.0`) and
never-review (`0.0`) are supported edge cases.

### 3. Cross-review enforcement: reviewer model must differ from producer (Accepted)

| Producer | Reviewer |
|----------|----------|
| haiku | sonnet (upward) |
| sonnet | opus (upward) |
| opus | sonnet (lateral, not downward) |

Implemented in `lib/review_agent.py::select_reviewer_model` and enforced in
`hooks/review-spawner.sh`. Operator override via `COS_REVIEW_MODEL` env var.

### 4. Default reviewer model: haiku (Accepted, with override)

Default reviewer tier is `haiku` per `cognitive-os.yaml review.default_model`.
The cross-review matrix (Decision 3) overrides this per-call. Operator can
override globally via `cognitive-os.yaml review.default_model` or per-session
via `COS_REVIEW_MODEL` env var.

### 5. Cost cap: 50 reviews/day (Accepted)

Daily budget tracked in `.cognitive-os/runtime/review-budget.json`. When
exhausted, `should_review()` returns False — reviews are skipped, NOT queued
for later dispatch (queuing would create unbounded latency drift). Budget
auto-rolls over at UTC midnight.

### 6. What to check: trust score validation + claim accuracy + AC coverage (Accepted)

The review prompt (from `build_review_prompt`) instructs the reviewer to:
1. Validate trust report honesty (score calibration, evidence quality)
2. Check claim accuracy (files claimed to exist, tests claimed to pass)
3. Check acceptance-criteria coverage
4. Flag hallucination indicators (confident claims without corroborating output)

NOT checked: code style, formatting, spelling.

### 7. Output: Engram + JSONL (Accepted)

Each finding is persisted to:
- `.cognitive-os/metrics/review-findings.jsonl` (offline analysis, schema stable)
- Engram observation type `review-finding` with topic_key
  `review-finding/<producer_id>-<content_hash8>`

Schema: `{score, evidence, gaps, recommendations, producer_id, producer_model,
reviewer_id, reviewer_model, reviewer_confidence, uncertainty, timestamp}`

### 8. No automatic skill modification in this phase (Accepted)

Findings surface to `/analyze-improvements` (Phase 1's downstream consumer).
The review agent emits data; it does NOT act on it. Closing the loop fully
(review → auto-modify) requires a separate implementation sprint with quality
data on review accuracy.

---

## Resolved questions

1. **Sync or async?** v1: sync (block until review done, document latency cost).
   v2 async (background + sweeper) is a follow-up ADR. Rationale: shipping
   something useful now > shipping nothing pending a complex async design.

2. **Self-review vs cross-review?** Cross-review, enforced by the model matrix.
   Same model reviewing its own output has known echo-chamber risks.

3. **Where do review findings persist?** Engram type=`review-finding` +
   `.cognitive-os/metrics/review-findings.jsonl`. Deduplication via content
   hash suffix in topic_key.

4. **Deduplication and loop prevention?** Content hash in topic_key prevents
   Engram upsert collisions. JSONL append is per-call (no dedup in JSONL —
   offline analysis is responsible for dedup there).

5. **Integration with `trust-score-validator.sh`?** The review agent runs as
   a separate PostToolUse hook, after trust-score-validator. The two hooks do
   NOT share state; trust-score-validator is lightweight (<200ms); review-spawner
   is heavier but fires only for sampled outputs.

## Implementation

| Artifact | Path | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| Library | `lib/review_agent.py` (source: `packages/agent-lifecycle/lib/review_agent.py`) | Public API: `should_review`, `select_reviewer_model`, `build_review_prompt`, `parse_review_response`, `persist_finding`, `daily_budget_state` |
| Hook | `hooks/review-spawner.sh` (source: `packages/agent-lifecycle/hooks/review-spawner.sh`) | PostToolUse on Agent; async marker + background sweeper by default |
| Skill | `skills/review-output/` (source: `packages/agent-lifecycle/skills/review-output/`) | Manual trigger: `/review-output --task-id <id>` or `--recent N` |
| Config | `cognitive-os.yaml review:` block | `sample_rate`, `max_per_day`, `default_model`, `async`, `always_review_kinds` |
| Unit tests | `tests/unit/test_review_agent.py` | All public functions; edge cases for should_review, parse_review_response |
| Integration tests | `tests/integration/test_review_agent_flow.py` | End-to-end: synthetic producer → gate → prompt → mock dispatch → persist |

### Hook registration

Register `review-spawner.sh` as a PostToolUse hook via `apply-efficiency-profile.sh`
or directly in `.claude/settings.json` under `hooks.PostToolUse` with matcher `Agent`.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Closes the self-reinforcing gap explicitly: the OS can detect its own
  errors in agent outputs, not just user corrections.
- Produces Engram evidence that downstream agents (and the user) can query
  ("what did the reviewer find about yesterday's deploy agent?").
- Enables the ADR-095 skill synthesis path: the reviewer is the natural place
  to detect skill opportunities in successful task completions.
- Cross-review matrix prevents echo chambers (reviewer always differs from producer).

### Negative

- **Background drift**: async review means findings may land after the parent
  hook exits. Markers make the drift explicit and auditable.
- **False trust risk**: a reviewer that consistently says "verified" provides
  false assurance. The prompt explicitly forbids rubber-stamping (MUST find
  at least 1 gap), but LLM compliance is stochastic. Meta-evaluation of review
  quality is a future follow-up.
- **Cost**: at 20% sample rate and haiku pricing, daily cost ≈ $0.02–$0.05
  for typical sprint load. Within governance bounds.

### Follow-up

- Async background dispatch shipped: pending markers plus `scripts/review_pending_sweeper.py`. Future work: schedule periodic sweeps for markers left behind after process crashes.
- Meta-evaluation phase 1 shipped: every persisted finding now includes a deterministic `review_quality` score/verdict that catches missing gaps, evidence, recommendations, confidence, and uncertainty. Future work remains: correlate review findings with later user corrections and acted-on improvements.
- `always_review_kinds: ["sdd-verify"]` for high-stakes task types — config
  hook already reads this field; enforcement is a 1-line extension.

## Alternatives rejected

| Alternative | Reason rejected |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Passive classifier only (current state) | Classifies user inputs, not agent outputs. The closed loop never fully closes — agent errors that users do not correct are invisible. |
| Human-in-the-loop only | Defeats the autonomous learning goal. Requires the user to manually audit every agent output. |
| Static linter / grep-based checker | Cannot evaluate claim accuracy or detect hallucination without LLM reasoning. |
| Extend `trust-score-validator.sh` to do claim verification | The hook already runs on every agent completion and is latency-sensitive. Adding LLM calls to it would violate its <200ms budget. |
| Same model for self-review | Echo chamber: same biases, same blind spots. Cross-review matrix prevents this. |

## Relationship to other ADRs

- ADR-090 (Accepted): detects and queues *failing skills* from metric data.
  No review agent involved.
- ADR-095 (Proposed): synthesizes *new skills* from success patterns.
  The review agent is the natural detector for ADR-095's "repeated success
  pattern" signal — the reviewer can say "this task pattern recurred; propose
  a skill."
- ADR-102 (Accepted): task-tracker lifecycle. Review findings reference
  producer_id which aligns with the task-tracker task IDs.
- ADR-099 (Accepted): pre-agent snapshot fix. Untracked files now survive
  agent launches, so review findings written during the hook are safe.
- Together ADR-090 + ADR-095 + ADR-096 form a complete learning loop:
  detect failure (090) → detect success patterns (095) → actively audit
  outputs (096).
