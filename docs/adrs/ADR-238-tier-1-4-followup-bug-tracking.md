# ADR-238 — Tier 1-4 Follow-Up Bug Tracking

## Status
Resolved

<!-- SCOPE: OS -->

**Status**: Resolved — all 5 bugs fixed (2026-05-08)
**Date**: 2026-05-07
**Related**: ADR-218 (history sanitization), ADR-237 (test execution efficiency)

---

## Context

During the Tier 1-4 case-study leak audit (privacy decoupling, commits
`ce8d1ea8` through `8f1c8f00`, 2026-05-07) and the subsequent post-merge
verification pass, five bugs were surfaced. None are blocking the audit's
primary goals (genericizing consumer tokens and fixture service names), but
all are real defects that must be tracked before public release.

This ADR records the bugs with enough detail to reproduce and fix them in
separate PRs. No fixes are applied here.

## Decision

Track each bug as a numbered entry with severity, affected file, reproducer,
proposed remediation, and current status. Fixes are deferred to individual
PRs that reference this ADR.

## Bug Registry

### Bug 1 — kpi-trigger.sh writes invalid JSON when reading mock fixtures

**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**File affected**: `scripts/kpi-trigger.sh`  
**Symptom**: When fed mock fixture data (as used in Tier 4 benchmark tests),
the script's JSON output is malformed — likely an unescaped field or missing
comma produced by ad-hoc string concatenation in bash.  
**Discovered**: Tier 4 sub-agent during fixture genericization (commit
`ce8d1ea8` era).

**Reproducer**:
```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/behavior/test_self_improvement.py -k kpi_trigger -q
# or, if no unit test yet:
bash scripts/kpi-trigger.sh --fixture tests/fixtures/mock_kpi_input.json | python3 -m json.tool
```

**Proposed remediation**: Replace the ad-hoc JSON construction in
`kpi-trigger.sh` with a `python3 -c` or `jq` pipeline that guarantees
well-formed output; add a unit test that pipes fixture data through the script
and validates JSON with `python3 -m json.tool`.

**Status**: fixed (commit `d00a9255`) — `packages/skill-governance/hooks/kpi-trigger.sh`
now builds the snapshot and flag JSON via `python3 -c json.dumps`, with a
defensive bash-string fallback. Verified manually with both well-formed and
malformed `skill-metrics.jsonl` fixtures (output passes `python -m json.tool`).

### Bug 2 — skill-invocation-mandatory.md references missing path

**Severity**: HIGH  
**File affected**: `rules/skill-invocation-mandatory.md`  
**Symptom**: The rule body references `.cognitive-os/sessions/events.jsonl`,
a path that does not exist on a fresh install. The audit test
`test_no_rule_references_missing_file` fails because this path is listed as
required but never created by any initializer.

**Reproducer**:
```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/audit/test_no_rule_references_missing_file.py -q
```

**Proposed remediation**: Either (a) update the reference in
`rules/skill-invocation-mandatory.md` to the actual path created on init, or
(b) add path creation to the `cognitive-os-init` flow so the file exists after
`/cognitive-os-init`. The rule text should not reference paths that only
materialise mid-session.

**Status**: fixed (commit `44fa5ff7`) — chose option (a) plus a wording
improvement. The rule now refers to the events stream conceptually and points
readers to `lib/harness_adapter/` for the harness-specific path resolver.
`tests/audit/test_rules_enforcement.py::test_no_rule_references_missing_file`
passes (116 rules audited, all green).

### Bug 3 — cos-status non-SO branch emits extra `concurrent_write` key

**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**File affected**: `scripts/cos_concurrent_status.py` (or equivalent;
locate via `grep -rln concurrent_write scripts/ lib/`)  
**Symptom**: When executed against a repository that is not a
Shared-Ownership (SO) project, the JSON output contains a `concurrent_write`
key that should only appear in SO contexts. This causes a schema mismatch in
consuming code and breaks the portability test.

**Reproducer**:
```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/red_team/portability/test_cos-coordination-status.py::test_snake_case_python_entrypoint_produces_json -q
```

**Proposed remediation**: Add a guard in `cos_concurrent_status.py` that
omits the `concurrent_write` key (and any other SO-specific keys) when the
project context does not indicate SO mode. Consider a schema variant or a
`--so-context` flag to make the conditional explicit.

**Status**: fixed (commit `f016843e`) — `lib/concurrent_agent_safety_status.py`
only sets `locks["concurrent_write"]` when `.cognitive-os/sessions/locks/` exists
on disk. Other lock keys (edit, git_index, plan, resource) remain unconditional
because their runtime/* paths are part of the canonical 4-key portability schema.
`tests/red_team/portability/cos_concurrent_status_test.py` and
`tests/red_team/portability/test_cos-coordination-status.py` both pass.

### Bug 4 — post-agent-verify snapshot restore emits "base blocked" instead of "baseline blocked"

**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**File affected**: `hooks/post-agent-verify.sh` (locate via
`grep -rln 'base blocked\|baseline blocked' hooks/`)  
**Symptom**: The error message produced when a snapshot restore is blocked
reads "base blocked" — the test assertion expects "baseline blocked". This is
a string-rename regression where the test was updated but the shell script was
not (or vice-versa).

**Reproducer**:
```bash
python3 -m pytest "tests/red_team/portability/post-agent-verify_test.py::test_falsification_out_of_scope_write_restores_from_snapshot" -q
```

**Proposed remediation**: Align the string literal in `post-agent-verify.sh`
with the test expectation ("baseline blocked"). Do a repo-wide grep for both
variants to confirm no other assertion depends on the old wording before
changing.

**Status**: fixed (commit `d628a6ed`) — root cause was deeper than a string
mismatch. The literal in `post-agent-verify.sh` was correct; the test failed
because `lib/snapshot_manager.plan_snapshot` only copied UNTRACKED files into
`.cognitive-os/snapshots/<id>/`, leaving tracked-modified files to a later
phase (`commit_snapshot_plan`). When the post-hook auto-restored, it fell
back to `git checkout HEAD -- <file>`, which restored the committed
"base blocked" instead of the pre-launch "baseline blocked" the user had
pinned. Extended `plan_snapshot` to also copy tracked-modified files
into the snapshot dir (reusing `_copy_untracked` with the existing size
budget). The existing `_restore_file` path in `post-agent-verify.sh` now
finds the snapshot copy before falling through.
`tests/red_team/portability/post-agent-verify_test.py
::test_falsification_out_of_scope_write_restores_from_snapshot` passes;
`tests/unit/test_snapshot_manager.py` still passes.

### Bug 5 — chaos test corrupts lib/targeted_test_resolver.py during test runs

**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**File affected**: `tests/chaos/test_global_verify_regression_catches.py`  
**Symptom**: During the test run, `lib/targeted_test_resolver.py` (149 lines,
real production code) gets overwritten with a 2-line test stub. The test
escapes its tmpdir sandbox and writes into the live source tree. This is the
most severe class of test bug: it silently corrupts production source code,
and any subsequent test run or import will load the stub instead of the real
module.

**Reproducer**:
```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/chaos/test_global_verify_regression_catches.py -q
# then verify:
wc -l lib/targeted_test_resolver.py   # should be 149; if 2, the bug triggered
```

**Proposed remediation**:
1. Identify where the test writes `lib/targeted_test_resolver.py` — replace
   the hardcoded path with a `tmp_path`-relative path or a monkeypatch of the
   module import.
2. Add a fixture-level guard (e.g., `autouse` session-scoped fixture) that
   records and asserts the inode/checksum of `lib/targeted_test_resolver.py`
   before and after each chaos test to catch any future escape.
3. Consider adding `lib/targeted_test_resolver.py` to a read-only
   `PROTECTED_SOURCE_FILES` list checked by a pre-test hook.
4. Restore `lib/targeted_test_resolver.py` from git after confirming the fix:
   `git checkout lib/targeted_test_resolver.py`.

**Status**: fixed (chaos-test edit folded into commit `e0d9ba75`) — `_FakeResolver`
now writes the fake into a `tmp_path`-rooted directory and the chaos test
injects it into the hook via the existing `VERIFY_RESOLVER_DIR` env var
(5th arg to the embedded python in `hooks/global-verify.sh`,
`sys.path`-prepended). A defense-in-depth assertion snapshots the real
resolver bytes before the test and verifies they are unchanged at the end —
if we ever regress, the test fails loudly instead of silently corrupting
production source. Verified: `lib/targeted_test_resolver.py` stays at 149
lines after the chaos test runs.

## Consequences

All 5 bugs are now resolved (2026-05-08, branch `session/m3-medium-resolutions-v2`):

- **Bug 5 / chaos test** (CRITICAL): test-safety violation closed; chaos test
  no longer writes to production source. Defense-in-depth byte-snapshot
  assertion guards against regression.
- **Bug 2** (HIGH): rule body no longer references a path that does not
  exist on a fresh install. CI audit test passes on a fresh clone.
- **Bug 1** (MEDIUM): `kpi-trigger.sh` JSON now passes `python -m json.tool`
  for both well-formed and malformed `skill-metrics.jsonl` fixtures.
- **Bug 3** (MEDIUM): non-SO consumers receive the canonical 4-key locks
  schema; `concurrent_write` only appears when the SO `sessions/locks/` dir
  exists.
- **Bug 4** (MEDIUM): pre-agent snapshot now captures tracked-modified files
  alongside untracked ones, restoring correct auto-restore semantics.

Each fix landed in its own commit (or its parent merge commit on a parallel
branch) referencing ADR-238 in the message.

## Alternatives rejected

- **Track each bug as a separate ADR (ADR-237b through ADR-237f).**
  Rejected: 5 thematically-linked follow-up bugs from a single audit pass
  fragment poorly across the ADR catalog and bloat numbering. A single
  consolidated ADR with a Bug Registry section keeps the audit chain
  navigable and lets each fix commit cite a single canonical ID.
- **File 5 GitHub issues instead of an ADR.**
  Rejected: this project does not use the issue tracker as the canonical
  decision record (see ADR-088 provenance model). ADRs are the durable
  audit surface; issues are ephemeral. Critical/HIGH severity findings
  belong in ADRs.
- **Auto-fix in the same commit as discovery.**
  Rejected: separation of concerns. Discovery happens during a focused
  audit (Tier 1-4 leak audit) where landing fixes inline would smear scope
  and complicate review. Tracking-then-fixing keeps each step verifiable.

## Verification

Each bug has an explicit reproducer command in its registry entry. The
fix commits cite the bug number; the test suite gates regression:

- Bug 1: `pytest tests/behavior/test_self_improvement.py -k kpi_trigger` (passes; commit `d00a9255`)
- Bug 2: `pytest tests/audit/test_rules_enforcement.py -k missing_file` (passes; commit `44fa5ff7`)
- Bug 3: `pytest tests/red_team/portability/cos_concurrent_status_test.py` (5/5; commit `f016843e`)
- Bug 4: `pytest tests/red_team/portability/post-agent-verify_test.py` (4/4; commit `4b18b25d`)
- Bug 5: `pytest tests/chaos/test_global_verify_regression_catches.py` then
  `wc -l lib/targeted_test_resolver.py` (must equal 149 — defense-in-depth
  byte-snapshot in the chaos test asserts this; commit `e0d9ba75`)

Whole-project verification: `pytest tests/red_team/portability/ -q` reports
**165/165 PASS** as of 2026-05-08 (closes C4 portability lane).
