# COS Install Operations

## Purpose

Use this skill for Cognitive OS install, bootstrap, upgrade, uninstall,
onboarding, and credential-safe operator setup flows.

## Protected command map

| Intent | Canonical script |
|---|---|
| Bootstrap/update COS surfaces | `scripts/cos-bootstrap.sh` |
| Credential-safe command runner | `scripts/cos-credential-safe-run` |
| Record onboarding evidence | `scripts/cos-record-onboarding.sh` |
| Weekly/profile config audit | `scripts/cos-weekly-config-audit.sh` |
| Initialize/project COS into a target | `scripts/cos_init.py` |
| Setup dependencies/profiles | `scripts/setup.sh` |
| Uninstall projected surfaces | `scripts/uninstall.sh` |
| Upgrade projected surfaces | `scripts/upgrade.sh` |

## Workflow

1. Prefer dry-run/JSON flags when the target script supports them.
2. Treat these scripts as protected install/profile surfaces: do not demote or
   archive them without checking `manifests/primitive-readiness-protected-install-surfaces.yaml`.
3. Never pass credentials inline; use environment variables or the credential-safe runner.
4. After install/profile changes, run the relevant doctor or audit before claiming success.

## Validation

```bash
bash -n scripts/cos-bootstrap.sh scripts/setup.sh scripts/uninstall.sh scripts/upgrade.sh
python3 -m py_compile scripts/cos_init.py
```
