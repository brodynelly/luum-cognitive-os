# Memory Layer Evolution SDD

## Goal

Design the Wave 2 memory bundle before touching Engram or Cognee code. The
radar proposes four related imports:

1. Graphiti-style temporal validity schema.
2. LightRAG-style dual-level retrieval scoring.
3. HippoRAG-style Personalized PageRank for multi-hop graph retrieval.
4. MIRIX-style memory class overlay.

These should be one coherent change, not four independent migrations.

## Non-goals

- Do not replace Engram wholesale with Graphiti, LightRAG, HippoRAG, or MIRIX.
- Do not add Neo4j/FalkorDB/Kuzu/Postgres/Redis as a default dependency.
- Do not make Cognee or any external memory backend mandatory.
- Do not change public memory claims until benchmark evidence exists.
- Do not reimplement a full RAG framework when COS needs a governed memory
  lifecycle.

## External patterns to evaluate

| Pattern | External source | Proposed COS use | Adoption kind |
|---|---|---|---|
| Temporal validity windows | Graphiti | Add `valid_from` / `valid_to` or equivalent to memory relations/observations. | schema-port |
| Episodes/provenance | Graphiti | Preserve raw observation/session as source of derived relation. | schema-port |
| Dual-level retrieval | LightRAG | Combine entity/relation recall with topic/semantic recall. | algorithm-port |
| Personalized PageRank | HippoRAG | Alternative graph walk mode for multi-hop memory retrieval. | algorithm-port |
| Memory class taxonomy | MIRIX | Add orthogonal `memory_class`: semantic, episodic, procedural, working. | schema-port |
| Structured optimization | DSPy | Optional eval harness for memory retrieval prompts/skills, not storage. | dependency-pilot |

## Proposed staged design

### Slice 0 — Benchmark and fixture design

Create a memory retrieval benchmark before changing defaults.

Fixture types:

- temporal contradiction: old decision superseded by newer decision;
- episodic query: "what happened during session X?";
- procedural query: "how do we run Y?";
- semantic query: "what is the current architecture decision for Z?";
- multi-hop query: decision -> ADR -> implementation file -> test.

Baseline:

- current FTS5 search;
- current graph walker BFS;
- current Cognee optional path if available.

### Slice 1 — Additive schema

Add fields without changing default behavior:

```text
valid_from       nullable timestamp
valid_to         nullable timestamp
memory_class     nullable enum: semantic|episodic|procedural|working
source_episode   nullable reference to raw observation/session/event
```

Backfill defaults should preserve existing results:

- `valid_from = created_at` when safe;
- `valid_to = superseded_at` when superseded, else null;
- `memory_class` inferred conservatively, with `unknown` or null allowed during
  migration.

### Slice 2 — Retrieval modes behind flags

Add retrieval strategies without changing default:

- `strategy=current`: current FTS5 + BFS behavior.
- `strategy=dual_level`: entity/relation + topic/semantic fusion.
- `strategy=ppr`: current search seed + Personalized PageRank on relation graph.
- `strategy=hybrid`: dual-level seed + PPR rerank.

### Slice 3 — Evaluation and default switch

Only switch defaults if benchmark shows improvement without unacceptable cost or
latency. Required metrics:

- precision@k;
- answer support/source correctness;
- temporal correctness;
- multi-hop success;
- p95 latency;
- token/cost delta;
- migration/runtime failure rate.

## Open design questions

1. Should semantic embeddings be local-only, optional provider-backed, or
   delegated to Cognee when available?
2. Does `memory_class` belong on observations, relations, or both?
3. How should Engram’s persistent memory privacy classes interact with
   `memory_class=working`?
4. Can we implement PPR without adding a heavy graph dependency?
5. What is the rollback if schema migration succeeds but retrieval quality
   regresses?

## Acceptance criteria before code

- A benchmark fixture plan is written and reviewed.
- Adoption kind is declared for every external pattern.
- Migration/backfill/rollback are specified.
- Public claims remain unchanged until benchmark evidence exists.
- Current retrieval mode remains available after all slices.
