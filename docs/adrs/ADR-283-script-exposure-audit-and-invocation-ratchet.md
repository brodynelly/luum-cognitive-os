# ADR-283: Script Exposure Audit and Invocation Ratchet

## Status

Accepted and implemented — 2026-05-12.

<!-- SCOPE: OS -->

**Date**: 2026-05-12

## Context

Cognitive OS has grown enough that a script existing in `scripts/` no longer
means an agent will know when to call it. This creates the same scalability
problem that ADR-282 solved for product answers: agents repeatedly rediscover a
large surface, spend tokens inspecting docs and ledgers, and still may miss the
right operational primitive.

The specific smell is not “many scripts”. The smell is unowned invocation:

```text
script exists
→ no skill consumer
→ no hook consumer
→ no command/router path
→ no explicit demotion to lab/migration/driver-specific
→ nobody reliably calls it
```

The primitive readiness ledgers already contain most of the raw facts, but there
was no dedicated P0/P1/P2/P3 audit that turns those facts into an actionable
exposure backlog.

## Decision

Add an ADR-283 script exposure audit primitive:

```bash
scripts/cos-script-exposure-audit
scripts/cos-script-exposure-audit --json
scripts/cos-script-exposure-audit --fail-p0
```

The audit reads `docs/reports/primitive-readiness-ledger-scripts-latest.json` by
default and classifies scripts into these priorities:

| Priority | Meaning | Expected action |
|---|---|---|
| P0 | `agentic-primitive` with no skill consumer | Add a skill consumer, document an equivalent hook/router route, or explicitly demote. |
| P1 | `maintainer-tool` with `total_consumers=0` | Archive, register, or wire to a maintainer entrypoint. |
| P2 | `maintainer-tool` with no skill consumer but with docs/tests/scripts consumers | Classify as internal or promote to a skill when it is meant for agents. |
| P3 | `lab`, `migration-only`, or `driver-specific` without skill consumer | Allowed exception if the lifecycle role is correct. |

P0 is further refined into exposure classes so manual triage does not confuse
“missing skill” with “unreachable”:

| Exposure class | Meaning | Expected action |
|---|---|---|
| `P0-unrouted` | No skill consumer and no observed hook/router/script/doc/test/config consumers. | Wire skill/hook/router or demote/archive. |
| `P0-route-undocumented` | No skill consumer, but a hook or command-router path is visible. | Document the equivalent route or add a skill. |
| `P0-promotion-candidate` | Docs/tests/config/scripts mention it, but no direct agent-facing route is visible. | Promote through skill/router or demote out of `agentic-primitive`. |

Command-router exposure is deliberately conservative: only central dispatcher
paths such as `scripts/cos` and future `cmd/*` entries count as router
consumers. A sibling `scripts/cos-*` consumer is just a script consumer unless it
is the dispatcher itself.

Manual route dispositions live in
`manifests/script-exposure-dispositions.yaml`. A row with
`resolution: documented_route` records the equivalent hook/router/operator path
and resolves the audit finding as `OK-documented-route` without pretending that
the script has a skill consumer.

The output is intentionally small and machine-readable:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "script-exposure-audit/v1",
  "adr": "ADR-283",
  "status": "warn",
  "summary": {
    "by_priority": {"P0": 60, "P1": 12, "P2": 300, "P3": 40, "OK": 100}
  },
  "findings": []
}
```

The audit does not claim every script needs a skill. It claims every script with
an agentic or maintainer role needs an explicit invocation story: skill, hook,
router, documented internal ownership, or demotion.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Agents can ask one cheap audit instead of rereading the whole scripts surface.
- Agentic primitives that are not reachable through skills become visible as P0.
- Maintainer tools with no consumers become visible as P1 instead of silently
  accumulating.
- Lab, migration-only, and driver-specific scripts remain legitimate exceptions
  instead of creating noisy “everything must be a skill” pressure.
- `--fail-p0` gives future CI or release lanes a ratchet without blocking the
  first inventory pass.

### Negative / trade-offs

- The audit depends on the freshness and fidelity of the primitive readiness
  scripts ledger.
- Some P0 rows may already have hook/router exposure; they still need either a
  skill, documented equivalent route, or explicit demotion to avoid ambiguity.
- The first version classifies command-router exposure heuristically from ledger
  consumers; richer router manifests can replace that later.

## Alternatives rejected

| Alternative | Why rejected |
|---|---|
| Manually inspect `scripts/` when confused | Repeats the token-heavy discovery loop and produces inconsistent answers. |
| Require every script to have a skill | Too blunt; lab, migration-only, driver-specific, and private maintainer helpers can be valid without skills. |
| Only rely on primitive readiness ledgers | Ledgers contain facts but not the P0/P1/P2/P3 backlog semantics needed by agents and maintainers. |
| Immediately delete zero-consumer scripts | Unsafe during reconstruction; visibility and classification should precede deletion. |

## Verification

```bash
python3 -m py_compile lib/script_exposure_audit.py scripts/cos-script-exposure-audit
python3 -m pytest tests/unit/test_script_exposure_audit.py tests/behavior/test_script_exposure_audit_cli.py -q
scripts/cos-script-exposure-audit --json
```
