# ADR-138: Flow Contract Schema — Required Shape for Cloud Flow Manifests

## Status

**Accepted and materialized for first lab registration.** The companion
artefact (`manifests/flow-contract-schema.yaml`) now exists because the first
lab flow contract (`skills/vuln-remediation-flow/flow_contract.yaml`) registers
against it. The schema remains **exemplary**, not shared, until a second flow
registers without modification.

## Context

[ADR-137](ADR-137-operational-trajectory-governance-layer-to-embedded-runtime.md) commits Cognitive OS to the trajectory `Framing B → Framing A` and introduces the **framing-exercise statement** as a required field in flow skill metadata. [ADR-134](ADR-134-headless-self-improvement-proposer.md) and [ADR-135](ADR-135-self-evolving-doctrine-proposals.md) define the propose-only contract for the self-improvement and doctrine proposers. The [`dx-cloud-flow-bootstrap-plan.md`](../architecture/dx-cloud-flow-bootstrap-plan.md) commits the bootstrap path: vulnerability remediation in sandbox as flow #1, with explicit bootstrap budget caps.

What is missing: a single, declarative shape that every flow primitive must satisfy. Today the propose-only contract for ADR-134 / ADR-135 lives inside the proposer scripts as constants. The flow primitives the bootstrap plan introduces need that contract generalised so that:

1. The first flow does not invent its own contract shape.
2. The second flow does not invent a different contract shape.
3. CI can audit a flow registration mechanically and reject any flow whose contract is incomplete or violates structural rules (anti-self-validation, propose-only, framing-exercise statement, lab-first promotion).
4. Future flows opt into the contract by reference, not by re-declaration.

This ADR commits the schema. The schema is intentionally minimal — enough to make the first flow safe, not enough to anticipate every future flow.

## Decision

Commit the following shape for `manifests/flow-contract-schema.yaml`. All flow primitives registered after this ADR lands MUST satisfy the shape; partial conformance is rejected by the registration audit.

### Top-level shape

```yaml
schema_version: 1
policy: >-
  Every cloud flow primitive declares its contract before it ships. The
  contract makes the flow's promises and limits machine-checkable. A flow
  whose contract is missing fields, contradictory, or inconsistent with
  ADR-137's framing-exercise statement is rejected at registration.

```

### Field-level rules

- `flow_id` MUST be unique across the registry. Re-registration with the same ID requires a `lifecycle_state` transition, not a silent overwrite.
- `lifecycle_state` MUST start at `lab` for any new flow ([ADR-133](ADR-133-expansion-without-monsterization.md)). Promotion requires the same evidence block ADR-126 mandates for `default-on` primitives.
- `input_source.determinism: deterministic` is a precondition for promotion beyond `advisory`. `best-effort` flows stay in `lab` / `sandbox` until the input source becomes deterministic or until evidence shows best-effort is acceptable for the flow class.
- `success_condition.verifier` MUST be runnable from CI without maintainer-machine assumptions. A verifier that requires `~/.claude/` or `~/.engram/` violates [`bootstrap-portability.md`](../architecture/bootstrap-portability.md).
- `sandboxed_write_paths` MUST exclude `manifests/`, `rules/`, `docs/adrs/`, and `.cognitive-os/runtime/` by default. A flow that needs to write into any of these requires an explicit per-path opt-in and a reason field.
- `blocked_actions` MUST include the five entries above as a minimum. Flow-specific additions are allowed; removals are not. The list mirrors the proposer constants from ADR-134.
- `human_approval_required: true` is hardcoded in the schema. A flow that proposes to remove this field fails validation. The trajectory committed in ADR-137 is `Framing B → Framing A`, not `human-in-loop → autonomous`.
- `evidence_shape.independence` mirrors `manifests/external-adoption-evidence.yaml` (commit `d4535df`). A flow whose evidence is `maintainer_owned: true` produces drill output, not adoption signal.
- `framing_exercise_statement` MUST have all five axes declared per [ADR-137](ADR-137-operational-trajectory-governance-layer-to-embedded-runtime.md). Missing axes block promotion out of `lab`. `partial` is a valid value but requires the `notes` field to explain what makes it partial.
- `non_goals` MUST contain at least one entry. An empty list is signal that the flow has not been thought about adversarially.
- `falsifiable_when` MUST contain at least one observable condition. This mirrors the stage-2 maturity property from [`cognitive-prosthesis.md`](../architecture/cognitive-prosthesis.md): every capability ships alongside the conditions under which it would be considered broken.

### Promotion rule for the schema itself

The schema is committed to **exemplary** status when this ADR lands. It moves to **shared** status — i.e., promoted from a flow-specific shape to a cross-flow contract — only after the **second flow** registers against it without modification. If the second flow needs to extend the schema, the extension lands as ADR-138a (or a new ADR) and the prior schema is preserved as a read-fallback.

This rule prevents two failure modes:

1. **Premature generalisation.** A schema generalised from a single flow encodes that flow's idiosyncrasies as universal truths.
2. **Drift.** A schema that grows fields per-flow without a promotion rule becomes a feature checklist, not a contract.

The promotion rule itself is enforced by `scripts/cos-flow-contract-audit` (to be created when the second flow registers).

## Acceptance Criteria

This ADR is satisfied when:

1. The first flow registered under [`dx-cloud-flow-bootstrap-plan.md`](../architecture/dx-cloud-flow-bootstrap-plan.md) (`vuln-remediation-flow`) carries a `flow_contract.yaml` (or equivalent) in its skill directory whose shape matches `required_flow_shape` above.
2. CI at registration time rejects a flow whose contract is missing any required field or whose values violate the field-level rules above. The implementation lives in `scripts/cos-flow-register.sh` (to be created).
3. The schema lands as `manifests/flow-contract-schema.yaml` no later than the first flow's `lab` registration. Until that point, the schema lives in this ADR as canonical reference.
4. After the second flow lands, either: (a) it registers against the unchanged schema and the schema is promoted to shared status, or (b) it requires extensions and a new ADR carries them. Silent schema evolution is rejected by audit.

## Border Cases

- **A flow whose verifier is non-deterministic** (e.g., LLM-as-judge for a documentation flow). Registers as `input_source.determinism: best-effort`, stays in `lab` until evidence shows best-effort is acceptable for that flow class. Does not block other flows.
- **A flow whose evidence cannot satisfy `independence` flags** because the maintainer is the first reviewer. Allowed in `lab` — registration captures the gap as `notes` under `evidence_shape`. Promotion beyond `advisory` requires non-maintainer review.
- **A flow that legitimately needs to write into `manifests/` or `rules/`** (e.g., a primitive-expansion flow). Registers `sandboxed_write_paths` with explicit per-path opt-in and a `reason` field. The audit log captures the opt-in for review.
- **A flow that proposes a new `lifecycle_state` value** not in the enumeration above. Rejected at registration; the lifecycle states are governed by ADR-126 and not extensible per-flow.
- **A flow that proposes `human_approval_required: false`** for autonomous operation. Rejected at registration; a future ADR (not this one) is required to relax the contract, and would supersede ADR-137's commitment.
- **The first flow lands but a registration audit script does not exist yet.** The contract is enforced by the maintainer reading the YAML against this ADR. The audit script is required before the second flow lands.

## Consequences

**Positive.**

- Every flow shipped under the bootstrap plan inherits the safety properties of ADR-134 / ADR-135 (propose-only, blocked actions, human approval) without re-declaring them.
- The `framing_exercise_statement` requirement from ADR-137 has a concrete home and a registration-time check, rather than living as prose in an architecture doc.
- The anti-self-validation schema from `external-adoption-evidence.yaml` extends naturally to flow output, closing the loop between flow execution and adoption-evidence reporting.
- A new contributor reading a flow's contract YAML can answer "what does this flow promise, what does it refuse, and when would it be considered broken?" without reading the implementation.

**Negative / risk.**

- The schema is a contract surface; every field is a maintenance commitment. The promotion rule (shared-only-after-second-flow) is the brake on uncontrolled growth.
- Some early flows may strain the schema and feel boilerplate-heavy. That is the intended cost: the propose-only contract was previously implicit and survived only through maintainer attention. Making it explicit costs YAML lines and saves debugging cycles.
- The schema may anchor the maintainer's flow design too tightly. Mitigation: the promotion rule allows ADR-138a or a new ADR to extend or replace the schema as evidence accumulates.

**Of not committing this schema.**

- Each flow invents its own contract shape. The propose-only properties drift from flow to flow, and CI cannot audit them mechanically.
- The framing-exercise statement requirement from ADR-137 has no enforcement point and becomes aspirational.
- The bootstrap plan's first-flow construction stalls on contract design instead of building flow logic.

## Operational Guide

### What changes for the operator

Before this ADR, each cloud flow primitive could invent its own contract shape.
The propose-only properties (blocked actions, human approval, framing-exercise
statement) existed only as constants in individual proposer scripts (ADR-134,
ADR-135) with no machine-auditable enforcement at registration time.

After this ADR:

- `manifests/flow-contract-schema.yaml` is the single canonical contract shape.
  Every flow registered under the bootstrap plan must satisfy it at registration
  time; partial conformance fails validation.
- The `human_approval_required: true` field is hardcoded. A flow cannot propose
  to remove it. Any attempt to set it to `false` is rejected at registration.
- The `lifecycle_state` must start at `lab` for every new flow. Promotion to
  `sandbox`, `advisory`, or beyond requires the evidence block ADR-126 mandates.
- The `framing_exercise_statement` field now has a concrete home with 5 required
  axes. Missing any axis blocks promotion out of `lab`.

### What this answers (and what it doesn't)

**Answers:**
- "What fields does my new flow contract YAML need?" — All fields under
  `required_flow_shape` in `manifests/flow-contract-schema.yaml` are required.
  The field-level rules in §Decision enumerate every constraint.
- "Can this flow auto-merge or auto-promote primitives?" — No. `auto_merge` and
  `auto_promote_core_or_team` are in `blocked_actions` and cannot be removed.
- "When does the schema become shared across multiple flows?" — After the second
  flow registers without modification. Until then the schema is `exemplary` and
  may be extended via ADR-138a.

**Does not answer:**
- Whether a specific flow's `success_condition.verifier` command works in the
  current environment. The schema enforces structural presence; you must run the
  verifier to confirm correctness.
- Which flows have been registered. Inspect the skills directory and the landscape
  manifest for that inventory.

### Daily operational pattern

**Registering a new flow:**

1. Create `skills/<flow-name>/flow_contract.yaml` with all fields from
   `manifests/flow-contract-schema.yaml §required_flow_shape`.
2. Set `lifecycle_state: lab`. All other lifecycle states require promotion
   evidence.
3. Confirm the `success_condition.verifier` is executable from CI without
   maintainer-machine paths (`~/` paths fail validation per
   `bootstrap-portability.md`).
4. Run the registration audit (once `scripts/cos-flow-register.sh` exists):
   ```bash
   bash scripts/cos-flow-register.sh skills/<flow-name>/flow_contract.yaml
   ```
   Until that script exists, the maintainer validates the YAML manually against
   the schema before landing the second flow.

**Promoting a flow from `lab` to `sandbox`:**

1. Collect the evidence block specified in ADR-126.
2. Update `lifecycle_state` in the flow's `flow_contract.yaml`.
3. The audit enforces that evidence is present before accepting the promotion.

### Reading guide for cold readers

If you encounter this ADR without context:

1. Read ADR-137 first — it commits the `Framing B → Framing A` trajectory and
   introduces the framing-exercise statement requirement that this schema enforces.
2. Read `manifests/flow-contract-schema.yaml` — the schema is the single source
   of truth for what a flow contract must contain.
3. The five `blocked_actions` (auto_merge, auto_promote_core_or_team,
   invent_evidence, bypass_governance_gate, direct_main_push) are the
   propose-only safety boundary generalised from ADR-134 / ADR-135. They are
   non-negotiable minimums for every flow.
4. The `promotion rule for the schema itself` (§Decision, near the end) explains
   when the schema transitions from `exemplary` to `shared`. Until the second flow
   lands, schema changes happen in this ADR; after that, they require a new ADR.

## Alternatives rejected

- Leave the ADR without an alternatives section — rejected because ADR-067+ audit contracts require a falsifiable record of considered options.
