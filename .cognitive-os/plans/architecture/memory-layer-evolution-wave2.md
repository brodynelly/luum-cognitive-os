## Intent

Start Wave 2 as a single SDD change named `memory-layer-evolution`.

The memory bundle is intentionally grouped because Graphiti-style temporal
validity, LightRAG-style dual-level retrieval, HippoRAG-style PPR, and
MIRIX-style memory classes all touch the same memory schema/retrieval boundary.
Splitting them into independent changes would create parallel schema migrations
and inconsistent evaluation criteria.

## Doctrine gate

External Tool Adoption Doctrine is already `status: accepted`. This SDD adopts
its core rule:

> Adopt commodity mechanisms; build governance semantics.

Therefore Wave 2 may import schemas/algorithms as **schema-port** or
**algorithm-port**, but Engram lifecycle, privacy classes, portability,
receipts, project scoping, and memory governance stay first-party COS semantics.

## Non-negotiables

- No default Neo4j/FalkorDB/Kuzu/Postgres/Redis dependency.
- No mandatory Graphiti, LightRAG, HippoRAG, MIRIX, Cognee, or DSPy runtime.
- No public claim updates before benchmark evidence exists.
- Current Engram search/retrieval remains available after every slice.
- Schema changes are additive, idempotent, and reversible.
- Privacy/portability classes from ADR-202 remain authoritative.

## Slice 0 — Benchmark and fixtures first

Before code changes to retrieval defaults, create a deterministic benchmark
suite that can fail a proposed memory algorithm.

### Fixture classes

| Fixture | Purpose | Minimum expected proof |
|---|---|---|
| temporal contradiction | Old decision superseded by a newer decision | newer decision ranks above stale decision and exposes source support |
| episodic query | Session-specific recall | answer cites correct session/event evidence |
| procedural query | How-to retrieval | retrieves the current runbook/procedure, not old chat fragments |
| semantic decision query | Current architecture/policy | retrieves accepted ADR/manifest over exploratory notes |
| multi-hop query | decision -> ADR -> implementation -> test | produces supported chain without hallucinated links |

### Baselines

- Current FTS5 search.
- Current graph walker / BFS retrieval.
- Existing optional Cognee path when available, opt-in only.

### Acceptance

- Fixtures are checked into tests, not only described in prose.
- The benchmark reports precision@k, temporal correctness, source support,
  multi-hop success, p95 latency, and token/cost delta.
- Failing benchmark cases become named regression tests before algorithm work.


## Slice 0 baseline result

Current local baseline command:

```bash
scripts/cos-memory-benchmark --strategy current-local --json \
  > docs/06-Daily/reports/memory-retrieval-baseline-current-local-2026-05-08.json
```

Result summary:

- status: `block`
- passed: `0/3`
- blocks: `3`
- temporal correctness: `1/3`
- source support: `2/3`

The baseline fails two temporal freshness checks and the explicit multi-hop
support-chain check. Therefore the next implementation order is:

1. M1 temporal schema/validity/supersession support;
2. M3 graph path/PPR or equivalent explicit support-chain retrieval;
3. M2 dual-level ranking after schema/path signals exist;
4. M4 memory class overlay last.

## Slice 1 — Additive schema

Add nullable fields without changing default behavior:

```text
valid_from       nullable timestamp
valid_to         nullable timestamp
memory_class     nullable enum: semantic|episodic|procedural|working|unknown
source_episode   nullable reference to raw observation/session/event
```

Backfill policy:

- `valid_from = created_at` only when created_at is known and trusted.
- `valid_to = superseded_at` when a supersession relation exists; else null.
- `memory_class = unknown` unless inference is deterministic.

### Acceptance

- Migration is idempotent.
- Rollback/downgrade is documented.
- Existing queries return identical top-k under `strategy=current`.
- No private-content portability class is weakened.


## Slice 1 implementation note

Slice 1 additive schema landed as an explicit, non-default migration helper:

- `lib/engram_wave2_schema.py` adds nullable `valid_from`, `valid_to`,
  `memory_class`, and `source_episode` columns to the Engram `observations`
  table.
- `scripts/cos-engram-wave2-schema-migrate --check|--write --json` provides an
  idempotent operator entrypoint.
- Backfill is deterministic: `valid_from = created_at` when present,
  `valid_to = memory_relations.superseded_at` for accepted supersession edges,
  `memory_class = unknown`, and `source_episode` remains null.
- `strategy=current` remains the default retrieval behavior.
- Rollback/downgrade path: restore the pre-migration Engram DB backup or keep the
  additive columns unused; callers that do not opt into Wave 2 fields continue to
  receive current-strategy results.

## Slice 2 — Retrieval modes behind flags

Add modes without changing default:

| Strategy | Description | Default? |
|---|---|---:|
| `current` | Current FTS5 + graph walk behavior | yes |
| `dual_level` | entity/relation + topic/semantic fusion | no |
| `ppr` | search seed + Personalized PageRank on relation graph | no |
| `hybrid` | dual-level seed + PPR rerank | no |

### Acceptance

- Each mode can be run on the same benchmark fixtures.
- Mode selection is explicit and observable in reports.
- Any mode failure falls back to `current` without corrupting state.

## Slice 3 — Evaluation and default switch decision

Switching defaults requires evidence, not enthusiasm.

Required evidence:

- better precision@k or source-support score than `current`;
- no temporal correctness regression;
- no unacceptable p95 latency or cost delta;
- no migration/runtime failure rate above agreed threshold;
- rollback tested.

If evidence is mixed, keep `current` as default and ship the improved mode as
manual/opt-in only.

## First implementation target

The next coding task is **Slice 0 only**:

1. Add a benchmark manifest under `manifests/memory-retrieval-benchmark.yaml`.
2. Add deterministic fixtures under `tests/fixtures/memory_retrieval/`.
3. Add a non-mutating benchmark runner under `scripts/cos-memory-benchmark`.
4. Add tests proving the runner catches stale temporal answers and unsupported
   multi-hop chains.

Do not touch Engram storage schema or retrieval defaults until Slice 0 is green.

## Slice 0 implementation note

Slice 0 landed as a non-mutating benchmark harness:

- `manifests/memory-retrieval-benchmark.yaml` declares fixture classes and metrics.
- `tests/fixtures/memory_retrieval/` contains deterministic temporal, procedural, and multi-hop fixtures.
- `lib/memory_retrieval_benchmark.py` evaluates candidate retrieval rows.
- `scripts/cos-memory-benchmark` runs the benchmark and blocks on required fixture failures.
- `tests/unit/test_memory_retrieval_benchmark.py` proves stale temporal answers and unsupported multi-hop chains fail.

Engram schema and retrieval defaults remain unchanged. The next allowed step is
Slice 1 additive schema design/implementation, with `strategy=current` preserved.


## Slice 1-4 local strategy results

All Wave 2 strategy work in this pass is benchmark-local and non-default. It does
not mutate Engram schema or change production retrieval defaults.

| Strategy | Wave item | Result | Delta vs baseline |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `current-local` | baseline | block, 0/3 pass | fails stale temporal + unsupported multi-hop |
| `temporal-local` | M1 | block, 2/3 pass | fixes both temporal failures; leaves multi-hop unsupported |
| `graph-path-local` | M3 | pass, 3/3 pass | adds exact relation support chain |
| `dual-level-local` | M2 | pass, 3/3 pass | preserves pass while adding entity/topic scoring shape |
| `memory-class-local` | M4 | pass, 3/3 pass | preserves pass while exposing memory_class overlay |

The next production-safe implementation step is to port M1's additive fields and
supersession reranking into the real Engram wrapper behind an explicit
non-default strategy flag.


## Wave 2 comparison decision

Comparison report: `docs/06-Daily/reports/memory-retrieval-wave2/comparison-2026-05-08.json`.

Winner: `graph-path-local`. It ties `dual-level-local` and `memory-class-local`
on score, but it is the smallest passing mode: M1 temporal validity plus M3
support-chain retrieval. Therefore the next real Engram port is **M1+M3**, not
M2 or M4. M2/M4 stay benchmark-proven but deferred until M1+M3 exist behind a
non-default runtime flag.
