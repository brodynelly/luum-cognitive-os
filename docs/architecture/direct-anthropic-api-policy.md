# Direct Anthropic API Policy

## Status

Accepted — reconstruction phase.

## Problem

Cognitive OS has two distinct ways to reach Claude-family models:

1. **Claude Code native execution** — local/operator sessions use the logged-in
   Claude Code account through the CLI or harness-native flow.
2. **Direct Anthropic API execution** — SDK/provider flows use
   `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and are billed per token.

These paths must not be activated by the mere presence of an ambient
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Process-level inheritance made the key visible to Claude
Code children, MCP servers, test processes, and workflow subprocesses even when
those children were supposed to use the native Claude Code account.

## Decision

Direct Anthropic API use is governed by the existing provider configuration:

```yaml
llm_providers:
  claude_sdk:
    enabled: false
```

`llm_providers.claude_sdk.enabled: true` is the single repo-level opt-in for
pay-per-token Anthropic SDK/provider usage. No additional ad-hoc environment
variable is introduced.

The policy has two levels:

- **Direct API provider enabled**: `llm_providers.claude_sdk.enabled is true`.
  This allows explicit provider calls such as `claude_sdk` when the API key and
  SDK are also present.
- **Advisor strategy enabled**: direct API provider is enabled **and**
  `ORCHESTRATOR_MODE=executor`. This preserves the original Advisor Strategy
  boundary: `sonnet+advisor` is executor-mode functionality, not normal local
  Claude Code account usage.


## Flow Classification

| Flow | Classification | Policy |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code local/operator sessions | Native harness account | Never require `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. |
| `claude_sdk` provider and `sonnet+advisor` executor path | Direct Anthropic API | Requires `llm_providers.claude_sdk.enabled: true`, SDK, key, and executor-mode when advisor is used. |
| `packages/advisor-mcp` | Optional external-advisor MCP transport | Defaults to safe `provider=auto`; Anthropic is last and policy-gated. |
| `packages/cos-advisory-llm` prompt hooks | Harness-native prompt hook extension | Uses prompt-type hook output; no direct provider API key required. |
| Cognee reference Docker profile | Optional memory service | Defaults to local Ollama + Fastembed; Anthropic only via explicit Cognee override. |
| GitHub Claude workflows | Explicit CI direct API | May use repository secret because CI has no local logged-in Claude Code account. |
| Promptfoo/DeepEval examples | Optional eval tooling | Examples should be provider-neutral or explicitly marked cost-bearing. |

## Why References Still Exist

The policy is **not** a total ban on the string `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. It is a
ban on accidental activation and default/local propagation. Remaining
references are allowed only when they fall into one of the categories below.

### 1. Explicit direct Anthropic API support

These files keep the opt-in `claude_sdk` / `sonnet+advisor` direct API path:

- `cognitive-os.yaml`
- `lib/anthropic_direct_policy.py`
- `lib/claude_executor.py`
- `packages/llm-providers/lib/claude_sdk.py`
- `packages/llm-providers/lib/__init__.py`
- `rules/model-routing.md`
- `pyproject.toml`

Reason: Cognitive OS still supports explicit pay-per-token Anthropic SDK usage
for executor-mode/advisor and direct-provider experiments. A key alone is not
enough; runtime code must also pass the `llm_providers.claude_sdk.enabled: true`
policy gate.

### 2. Explicit CI workflows

These files use the GitHub secret for Claude Code actions:

- `.github/workflows/claude-interactive.yml`
- `.github/workflows/claude-issue-triage.yml`
- `.github/workflows/claude-pr-review.yml`
- `docs/automation.md`
- `workflows/README.md`

Reason: GitHub Actions cannot rely on a developer's local logged-in Claude Code
account. These are CI-only direct API flows, not local/operator defaults.

### 3. Optional external advisor transport

These files document or implement the `advisor-mcp` Anthropic provider:

- `packages/advisor-mcp/advisor_server.py`
- `packages/advisor-mcp/README.md`
- `packages/advisor-mcp/cos-package.yaml`
- `docs/architecture/advisor-mcp-architecture-review.md`

Reason: `advisor-mcp` is an optional external-advisor MCP transport. It defaults
to safe `provider=auto`, does not pass `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the default MCP
registration example, and selects Anthropic only when the shared direct API
policy and credentials are present.

### 4. Optional Cognee override documentation

Remaining Cognee docs may show how to opt into Anthropic manually:

- `infra/cognee/README.md`

Reason: the reference Docker profile defaults to local Ollama + Fastembed and
does not propagate `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. The Anthropic mention is an explicit
override example for users who choose direct API extraction.

### 5. Historical records

Historical decision and handoff documents may discuss direct Anthropic API
billing, but they should avoid repeating the exact environment variable unless
the variable name itself is technically necessary. The canonical policy and
audit own the exact string.

Reason: historical documents are not runtime surfaces, but reducing repeated
variable names makes future grep output smaller and easier to review.

### 6. Tests, benchmarks, and audits

Tests and benchmark configs use the variable as a fixture or explicit
cost-bearing provider requirement:

- `tests/unit/test_*`
- `tests/audit/test_anthropic_api_key_references.py`
- `tests/arena/arena-config.yaml`
- `docs/benchmarks/so-vs-vanilla-tasks.yaml`

Reason: tests must be able to prove that the key does **not** activate direct
API flows by itself. Arena/benchmark configs are explicitly cost-bearing and
not part of local defaults.

## Forbidden References

New references are forbidden unless they are classified in
`tests/audit/test_anthropic_api_key_references.py`. In particular, the following
surfaces must not introduce unclassified `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` usage:

- default Docker Compose services;
- bootstrap next-step output;
- default `.env` examples;
- native prompt-hook packages such as `packages/cos-advisory-llm`;
- Cognee default skill/package configuration;
- MCP registration examples that run by default.

## Consequences

- Ambient `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is not propagated to Claude CLI subprocess safe
  environments.
- `select_model(..., use_advisor=True)` means "prefer advisor if available";
  it does not force a disabled direct-API path.
- `ClaudeExecutor.run_with_advisor()` enforces the same policy as the router,
  so direct callers cannot bypass the router and spend API tokens outside the
  configured executor-mode path.
- `packages/llm-providers/lib/claude_sdk.py` must check the same direct API
  provider policy before reporting itself configured.
- GitHub Actions may still use repository secrets explicitly because CI cannot
  rely on a local logged-in Claude Code account. Those workflows are separate
  from local/operator defaults.
- Optional service defaults must not select Anthropic direct API. Cognee defaults
  to local Ollama/Fastembed, and `cos-advisory-llm` uses harness-native prompt
  hooks rather than SDK calls.

## Rejected alternatives

- **New env var gate**: rejected
  because it adds another policy surface when `cognitive-os.yaml` already owns
  provider enablement.
- **API key presence as activation**: rejected because it makes ambient process
  inheritance change billing behavior.
- **Disabling all Anthropic API code**: rejected for now because CI, benchmarks,
  and model-agnostic advisor experiments may still need explicit direct API
  paths.

## Verification

- Unit tests cover enabled/disabled provider config using real temporary
  `cognitive-os.yaml` files.
- Router and executor tests cover fallback when advisor is disabled.
- `tests/unit/test_direct_anthropic_default_surfaces.py` blocks default/local
  surfaces from reintroducing active Anthropic key requirements.
- `tests/audit/test_anthropic_api_key_references.py` classifies every remaining
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` reference and fails on both unclassified new references
  and stale allowlist entries.
