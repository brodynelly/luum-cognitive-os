## Top Findings

- `script:scripts/cos-key-learnings-capture` [partial/medium]: Candidate/projectable surface needs consumer projection proof → add harness projection proof before promotion
- `script:scripts/security-red-team` [partial/medium]: Candidate/projectable surface needs consumer projection proof → add harness projection proof before promotion
- `harness_coverage:hooks/agent-control-inbound-guard.sh` [partial/medium]: Harness implementation coverage gap → classify the gap policy or add the missing harness projection/proof
- `harness_coverage:hooks/agent-launch-confirmed.sh` [partial/medium]: Harness implementation coverage gap → classify the gap policy or add the missing harness projection/proof
- `harness_coverage:hooks/ai-provider-identity-guard.sh` [partial/medium]: Harness implementation coverage gap → classify the gap policy or add the missing harness projection/proof

## New Debt

- none

## Context Diet Rule

- Do not open full JSON ledgers unless debugging the pipeline itself.
- Prefer this compact file, `python3 scripts/acc_pipeline.py --brief`, or targeted JSON queries.
- Subagents should receive only selected rows/findings, not complete ACC/readiness reports.
