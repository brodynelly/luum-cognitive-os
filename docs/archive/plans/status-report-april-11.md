## PARTIAL (some work committed, more needed)

| ID | Description | What's Done | What's Missing |
|---|---|---|---|
| WS1 (Phase 3-4) | Rules-to-hooks completion | EXCLUDED_RULES mechanism built; 87 rules excluded; TO-1 reduces to 18 active rules | Phase 3: Decide auto-refine.sh/auto-verify.sh/dod-gate.sh registration (standard vs paranoid); Phase 4: RULES-COMPACT.md regeneration at <1.5K tokens (currently ~2.1K) |
| WS4 (Phases 2-4) | Skill atomicity — remaining 21 splits | Phase 1 done (10 skills from 3 splits); issue-pipeline not deleted | Phase 2: parameterize coverage-enforcement, readiness-check, evaluate-plan, secret-audit, plan-feature/plan-bug; Phase 3: agent-kpis per-OKR split, singularity sub-commands; Phase 4: 11 integration skill dedup |
| WS5 (remaining) | Docs-to-skills conversions | 8 SKILL-EXISTS docs trimmed to stubs | 9 SKILL-CANDIDATE docs not yet converted: /cos-setup, /cos-install, /cos-quickstart, /switch-security-profile, /cos-docker-setup, /run-benchmark, /configure-quality-gates, /dogfood-check, /test-agent-teams |

## LOST / CRASH VICTIMS (attempted but no commit — needs relaunch)

Based on git status showing 74 deleted symlinks in .claude/rules/cos/ and modified files with no commit, plus the timeline gap between sessions:

| ID | Description | Evidence | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| self-install run | TO-1 expanded EXCLUDED_RULES to 87 but .claude/rules/cos/ still has 74 stale symlinks (git shows as unstaged deletions) | 74 D entries in `git status` for .claude/rules/cos/; .claude/settings.json M | HIGH — commit these to clean up; run self-install.sh to regenerate |
| skills/CATALOG.md update | CATALOG.md has 122 lines of uncommitted additions (new skills from WS4, WS13b, WS16, etc.) | M skills/CATALOG.md in git status | HIGH — uncommitted work from skill-tracker fix |
| c67fccb skill-metrics fix | skill-tracker.sh tokens/duration fix committed but packages/skill-governance/hooks/skill-tracker.sh still has unstaged diff | M packages/skill-governance/hooks/skill-tracker.sh | MEDIUM — confirm if timing fix is complete |

## NOT STARTED (from plans)

### Self-Optimizing Pipeline

| ID | Description | Plan | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| WS6 | Agentic primitive scope tags — add scope: frontmatter to ~260 files, filter by scope in self-install.sh and cos install | self-optimizing-pipeline.md | P3 |
| WS8 | Auto-classification detector hook (component-classification-detector.sh) | self-optimizing-pipeline.md | P4; depends on WS6 |
| WS9 | Test error ratchet — fix 292 pytest errors, extend pre-commit-gate.sh with error tracking | self-optimizing-pipeline.md | P1; 292 errors blocking quality |
| WS10 | Security tool activation — enable semgrep, register aguara-scan.sh, validate garak/promptfoo | self-optimizing-pipeline.md | P2 |

---

## ADDITIONAL WORK (not in WS/TO plans — extra deliverables)

| Commit | Description | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| c5e3d70 | Host resource monitor — adaptive agent throttling (lib/host_monitor.py) | 54 tests; macOS+Linux; pressure levels map to max agent count |

| 872c6d6 | Orchestrator capability detector — auto-detect comm mode | lib/orchestrator_capability_detector.py |
| cd7ecdb | Release analyzer — intelligent release planning tool | lib/release_analyzer.py |
| bd67cef, d05b23a | packages/project-discovery + packages/project-audit | Pre-development planning pipeline |
| 4d59de1 | /register-component skill — OS internal consistency checker | |
| ed3f90b | /session-backlog, /session-wrapup, /add-hook, /add-rule, /add-skill, /add-mcp skills | 6 new skills |
| 9eb44c3 | 5 lib modules pre-WS (output extractor, smart truncator, return contract parser, queue advisor, request queue) | Foundation for WS2/WS12 |
| a49a229 | Fix 31 broken window test failures | Cleanup |
| 77ad741 | Fix clarification-gate false positive + 12 test regressions + delete 3 deprecated hooks | |
| 59f0d8b | Archon evaluation, 8 docs trimmed, 2 archived, 8 plans created | Planning work |
| c67fccb | Fix skill-metrics tracker — tokens and duration now non-zero | |

## UNCOMMITTED FILES (potential crash victims + pending commits)

```
M  .claude/plugins/hermes-agent        (submodule update — likely legitimate)
M  .claude/plugins/pi-mono             (submodule update — likely legitimate)
D  .claude/rules/cos/[74 files]        (stale symlinks — run self-install.sh to clean + commit)
M  packages/skill-governance/hooks/skill-tracker.sh  (timing fix from c67fccb not fully committed)
M  skills/CATALOG.md                   (122 new lines — uncommitted skill catalog additions)
```

**Action required**:
1. Run `bash hooks/self-install.sh` to regenerate `.claude/rules/cos/` with EXCLUDED_RULES applied → commit the resulting deletions
2. Stage and commit `skills/CATALOG.md` additions
3. Review `packages/skill-governance/hooks/skill-tracker.sh` diff — if timing fix is complete, commit it

## AUDIT ACTIONS PENDING

| Audit | Action Needed | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| dead-weight-audit.md | Fix lib/component_usage_tracker.py to add 4 search patterns (cross-lib imports, packages/*/lib/, `from lib import X`, `from X import`); add EXCLUDED_RULES scan to scan_rule_references() | MEDIUM |
| docs-to-skills-audit.md | Convert 9 SKILL-CANDIDATE docs to atomic skills (/cos-setup, /cos-install, /cos-quickstart, /switch-security-profile, /cos-docker-setup, /run-benchmark, /configure-quality-gates, /dogfood-check, /test-agent-teams) | MEDIUM |
| skill-atomicity-audit.md | WS4 Phases 2-4 (21 remaining splits) | LOW-MEDIUM |

## RECOMMENDED NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

1. **IMMEDIATE: Commit uncommitted work** — Run `self-install.sh` → commit 74 `.claude/rules/cos/` deletions + `skills/CATALOG.md` additions + `skill-tracker.sh` timing fix. This closes the "crash survivor" gap cleanly. (~15 min)

2. **WS9: Test Error Ratchet (P1)** — 292 pytest errors block quality gates. Classify errors (infra-dependent vs fixable), fix fixable ones, add ratchet to pre-commit-gate.sh. This is the most important quality debt item. (~2-3 sessions)

3. **WS5 remaining: 9 SKILL-CANDIDATE conversions (P2)** — ~43K tokens always-loaded → on-demand. High token savings, mechanical work. Priority: /cos-setup, /cos-install, /cos-quickstart first (most-used setup flows). (~2 sessions)

4. **WS1 Phase 3-4 completion (P0)** — Decide auto-refine/auto-verify/dod-gate registration; slim RULES-COMPACT.md to <1.5K tokens. Required to fully close the rules-to-hooks refactor. (~0.5 sessions)

5. **WS4 Phase 2: Skill parameterization (P1)** — coverage-enforcement, readiness-check, secret-audit read from config rather than hardcoded. Enables scope-agnostic skills. (~1 session)

6. **WS10: Security tool activation (P2)** — Enable semgrep (1 env var), register aguara-scan.sh in paranoid profile, run garak + promptfoo validation. Mostly configuration, low effort, high security value. (~0.5-1 session)

7. **WS6: Scope tags (P3)** — Mechanical bulk frontmatter addition (~260 files). Prerequisites: WS1 Phase 4 complete. Can be batched with haiku. (~2 sessions)
