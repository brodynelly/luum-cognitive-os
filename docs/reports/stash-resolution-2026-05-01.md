# Stash Resolution Report — 2026-05-01
> Local stash stack audit before clearing accumulated WIP stashes. Each stash was archived under `refs/archive/stashes/2026-05-01/<n>` before any cleanup.
## Retrieval
To inspect an archived stash after the normal stash stack is cleared:
```bash
git show refs/archive/stashes/2026-05-01/0
git stash branch recover-stash-0 refs/archive/stashes/2026-05-01/0
```
A local bundle was also created at `.git/stash-archive-2026-05-01.bundle`.

## Resolution Policy

- `already applied`: safe to clear from stash stack; current history already contains equivalent changes.
- `empty patch`: safe to clear from stash stack; no working-tree patch remains.
- `applies cleanly but unreviewed`: archived instead of auto-applying because these are unrelated generated/WIP changes.
- `conflicts or stale`: archived instead of auto-applying because the patch conflicts with current main or depends on old tree shape.

No stash is destroyed without an archive ref and local bundle.
