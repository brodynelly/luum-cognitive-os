# Queue Drain Protocol

## Purpose

When dispatch-gate.sh blocks an agent launch (all slots full), the agent prompt
is automatically enqueued in `.cognitive-os/tasks/dispatch-queue.json`.
On each task completion, the orchestrator MUST drain the queue.

## When to Drain

**Trigger**: Every time a sub-agent or task completes (task-notification arrives).

## Action Protocol

```
1. Import and check the queue:
   from lib.queue_drainer import QueueDrainer
   drainer = QueueDrainer()
   ready = drainer.get_ready_agents()

2. If ready is non-empty:
   - For each agent in ready:
     a. drainer.mark_dispatched(agent["id"])
     b. Launch the agent using the agent["prompt"] and agent["model"]
     c. On completion: drainer.remove_completed(agent["id"])

3. If ready is empty:
   - Continue normally (queue empty or no slots available yet)
```

## Shell One-Liner (for hooks)

```bash
python3 -c "
from lib.queue_drainer import QueueDrainer
d = QueueDrainer()
print(d.format_drain_instruction())
"
```

## Queue File

Location: `.cognitive-os/tasks/dispatch-queue.json`

Schema per item:
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "prompt": "the full agent prompt",
  "description": "short description",
  "model": "sonnet",
  "priority": 5,
  "enqueued_at": "ISO-8601",
  "status": "queued | dispatching"
}
```

## Priority Rules

- Items are launched in priority order (1=critical, 5=normal, 10=low)
- Within the same priority, FIFO ordering applies
- Items older than 4 hours are auto-pruned

## Idempotency

The same prompt is never enqueued twice. Re-submitting an identical prompt
returns the existing queue item ID without adding a duplicate.

## CronCreate Scheduling (Periodic Fallback)

When agents are queued but no completion event is expected soon (e.g., all active
agents finish simultaneously and no `completion-gate` fires), a CronCreate scheduled
task prevents stuck queue items.

### When to create the scheduled task

Create the CronCreate task when:
- `dispatch-gate.sh` blocks a launch and enqueues an agent
- The orchestrator detects items in `.cognitive-os/tasks/dispatch-queue.json`

```python
from lib.scheduled_drain import should_schedule_drain, get_cron_create_spec

if should_schedule_drain():
    spec = get_cron_create_spec()
    # Use CronCreate tool with spec["prompt"], runs every 5 minutes
```

### CronCreate prompt (what the scheduled session runs)

```
Check the agent dispatch queue and launch any ready agents.

1. Run: python3 -c "from lib.scheduled_drain import drain_and_report; print(drain_and_report())"
2. If agents are ready, launch them using the Agent tool with the queued prompt and model
3. For each agent: mark_dispatched(id) before, remove_completed(id) after
4. If dead agents found, escalate to user
5. If queue is empty: report "Queue empty — no action needed" and do NOT reschedule
```

### Cost management

Each CronCreate session costs ~$0.03–0.10. To avoid polling an empty queue:
- Cancel or stop re-scheduling when `should_schedule_drain()` returns `False`
- The scheduled task itself checks `format_drain_instruction()` and exits early if empty

### Skill

Use `/queue-drain` skill (`skills/queue-drain/SKILL.md`) inside the CronCreate session
for full step-by-step instructions.

## Integration

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `hooks/dispatch-gate.sh` | Enqueues blocked launches (PreToolUse) |
| `lib/queue_drainer.py` | Queue management: enqueue, get_ready, mark_dispatched, remove_completed |
| `lib/scheduled_drain.py` | Combined drain + health report; CronCreate spec helper |
| `lib/dispatch_helper.py` | Slot availability check (active task count vs max_parallel_agents) |
| `skills/queue-drain/SKILL.md` | Instructions for the CronCreate session |
| `.cognitive-os/tasks/dispatch-queue.json` | Persistent queue file |

## Contextual Trigger

This rule is loaded when: dispatch queue, agent queued, queue drain, blocked agent launch,
slot available, task completion, cron drain, scheduled drain.
