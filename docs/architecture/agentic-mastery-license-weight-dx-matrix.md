# Agentic Mastery — License, Weight, and DX Matrix

> Date: 2026-05-02
> Purpose: decide which external agentic-AI tools can influence Cognitive OS, which can be optional adapters, and which must stay out of the core.

## Policy

Cognitive OS implements the mandatory path with a **small deterministic internal core**. External tools are allowed only as:

1. **Reference** — learn from the design; no dependency.
2. **Optional CLI / dev lane** — operator installs explicitly; never required by default.
3. **Optional benchmark adapter** — only for benchmark lanes; not part of project install.
4. **Blocked** — incompatible license, excessive weight, unclear provenance, or unacceptable data-sharing behavior.

No tool may become a default dependency until it passes a pinned-version license gate.

## License gate requirements

Before any integration moves beyond reference status, record:

| Field | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Repository | Canonical upstream URL. |
| Version | Immutable tag, release, or commit. |
| License | SPDX ID from upstream license file and package metadata. |
| Transitive dependencies | Scan with the repo license policy; AGPL/SSPL/BSL/ELv2 stay blocked. |
| Install mode | `none`, `optional-cli`, `optional-container`, `dev-only`, or `vendored`. |
| Data sharing | Whether prompts, code, tool descriptions, or skill contents leave the machine. |
| Default impact | Must be zero for fresh COS installs unless explicitly accepted. |

## Weight scale

| Weight | Meaning |
|---|---|
| None | Used only as reference or docs. |
| Low | Small Python/Bash module, no new service, no Docker, no large dataset. |
| Medium | Adds a CLI/package or extra test/report path, but not on hot path. |
| High | Requires npm/Python dependency trees, external APIs, or long-running scans. |
| Very high | Requires Docker images, benchmark datasets, browser/OS environments, or multi-repo harnesses. |

## DX scale

| DX value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| High | Improves daily operator confidence or prevents severe agent mistakes. |
| Medium | Useful for maintainers or periodic quality work. |
| Low | Mostly research/comparison value. |

## Default install impact

Default Cognitive OS install should add only:

| Capability | Default impact |
|---|---|
| Lethal Trifecta Gate | One small Python module + one Bash hook + JSONL metrics. |
| ACI MVP | One normalizer module + docs/contracts, once implemented. |
| Skill efficacy | Reads existing metrics; reports generated only on demand. |
| Runtime benchmark | No default runtime cost; tasks run only by explicit command. |
| Adversarial generalization | No default runtime cost; scenarios generated only by explicit command. |

No Docker images, external benchmark datasets, npm trees, model eval frameworks, or SaaS scanners should be installed by default.

## DX impact

| Capability | Developer-facing value | Risk if overbuilt |
|---|---|---|
| Lethal Trifecta Gate | Higher confidence using agents around private repos and untrusted issue/docs content. | False positives blocking legitimate workflows. |
| ACI | Less context waste, clearer failures, better tool observations. | Wrapping tools too much and hiding useful raw evidence. |
| Skill efficacy | Shows which skills help, cost, or regress. | Metric noise if tasks are not paired fairly. |
| Vanilla-vs-COS benchmark | Proves whether COS helps versus vanilla. | Expensive, flaky benchmarks if too large too early. |
| Adversarial generalization | Catches failures contract tests miss. | Scenario explosion and slow local validation. |

## Implementation decision

The approved direction is:

1. Build internal deterministic cores first.
2. Keep all external tools opt-in.
3. Require pinned-version license evidence before each adapter.
4. Benchmark before making DX claims.
5. Present simple reports: `safety`, `aci`, `skills`, `benchmark`, `adversarial`.


## Automated license gate

The pinned optional-tool manifest lives at `.cognitive-os/tests/agentic-tools/license-matrix.json` and is checked by `scripts/agentic-tool-license-matrix.py`. The script is stdlib-only, requires no network access, blocks AGPL/SSPL/BSL/ELv2/Commons-Clause license families, and blocks `default_enabled=true` for external tools with `High` or `Very high` weight. It can emit Markdown and JSON reports for CI or local review.

## Near-term actions

1. Implement Lethal Trifecta Gate MVP.
2. Add `scripts/agentic-tool-license-matrix.py` later to refresh this matrix from pinned metadata.
3. Add optional-tool status reporting to `make test-agentic-mastery` once that target exists.
