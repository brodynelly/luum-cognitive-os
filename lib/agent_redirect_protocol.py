"""Agent redirect protocol (ADR-056 Level 2).

Text-based protocol for the L2 block hook to communicate with the parent
orchestrator. When the hook blocks an Agent() call due to quota pressure
or recent rate-limit events, it emits an AGENT_REDIRECT block on stderr.
The orchestrator parses this block and re-issues the call through
`scripts/orchestrator.py run --providers qwen,claude` instead.

Protocol is deliberately LLM-harness agnostic: structured text, not JSON
or MCP tool calls, so it survives any transport (Claude Code hooks,
Cline, Cursor, Qwen Code, custom harnesses).

Block format (stable — do not change without versioning):

    AGENT_REDIRECT: reason=<quota_pressure|rate_limit> pressure=<N.NN>
    SUGGESTED_COMMAND: uv run python3 scripts/orchestrator.py run --task '<prompt>' --providers qwen,claude

The block always occupies exactly 2 lines. No trailing content is part
of the protocol. `<prompt>` is POSIX-shell-quoted via shlex.quote() to
preserve newlines and special characters (backticks, $, !, etc).

  - docs/02-Decisions/adrs/ADR-056-adaptive-agent-dispatch.md (Agent A owns)
  - hooks/agent-quota-redirect.sh (consumer of build_redirect_message)
