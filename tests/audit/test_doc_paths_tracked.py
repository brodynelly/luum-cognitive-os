"""AUDIT: prevent ADR-069 §5 regression — gitignored paths cited as authoritative storage.

This test would have caught the original bug. It does NOT just verify the current
state; it verifies the PATTERN cannot recur.

ROOT CAUSE: ADR-069 §5 originally specified `.cognitive-os/reports/research/` as the
canonical storage path for research reports. Since `.cognitive-os/` is gitignored,
reports ended up duplicated at two paths, inflating /decision-triage counts by 3x.

FIX (2026-04-27): ADR-069 §5 updated to use `docs/06-Daily/reports/` (git-tracked). This test
FAILS if any ADR/rule/template references `.cognitive-os/<something>/<something>.md`
as an authoritative storage path without an explicit opt-out annotation.
