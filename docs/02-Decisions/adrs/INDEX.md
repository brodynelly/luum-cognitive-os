# ADR Index

## How to Use This Index

This generated table is the status inventory for all 337 Architecture Decision Record files (ADRs).
Status semantics are defined in [STATUS-TAXONOMY.md](STATUS-TAXONOMY.md): decision status, implementation status, and index bucket are separate fields.
Rows link to the canonical ADR file and group by index bucket for human and agent navigation.
