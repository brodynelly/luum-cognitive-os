## Status legend

Each feature row carries a status marker. Read these as honesty markers, not
quality judgments — `DORMANT` and `ASPIRATIONAL` items often have working code
behind a feature flag or are documented as next-cycle work.

- **REAL** — production-ready, hook-enforced or covered by unit/behaviour tests
  and wired into the default flow
- **DORMANT** — code exists and is exercised by tests, but feature-flagged off
  or only active under a specific harness/profile (the user must opt in)
- **ASPIRATIONAL** — design and partial scaffolding exist; the loop is not yet
  closed end-to-end. Tracked as future work, not as a shipped capability

Source of truth: `rules/RULES-COMPACT.md`, weekly aspirational audit at
`docs/06-Daily/reports/aspirational-audit-*.md`, full reconciliation at
`docs/09-Quality/legal/h1-feature-status-audit.md`.

| 17 | Automation Workflows | DORMANT | Pipeline templates for ticket-to-code, bugfix, migration, deploy, and service scaffolding | Turnkey ticket-to-prod automation is operator-assembled, not pre-wired |
| 18 | Manifest-Driven Governance | REAL | Schema-versioned manifests and audits cover the promoted governance surface | Primitive-level coverage is ratcheted; "every primitive" is not claimed until audits prove it |
| 19 | Source-Available Core | REAL | FSL-1.1-MIT core + plugin system (converts to MIT after 2 years) | Self-host, use internally, run in production, contribute, and build products where Cognitive OS is not the primary product |

## 1. Persistent Memory (Engram)

Your AI assistant forgets everything when the session ends. Cognitive OS solves this.

**How it works:**
- Engram provides persistent, searchable memory across all sessions via the MCP protocol
- Automatic save triggers fire after decisions, bug fixes, discoveries, and conventions
- Full-text search (FTS5) over all past observations
- Session summaries are automatically saved before each session close and context compaction
- Topic keys organize knowledge hierarchically (e.g., `architecture/auth-model`, `sre-fix/mysql/connection-refused`)
- Private mode disables all persistence for sensitive conversations

**What exists today:**
- Engram MCP server
- Proactive save protocol with 4 trigger categories
- Session close protocol ensuring no knowledge is lost
- Post-compaction recovery
- Git-based sync for shared knowledge bases

---

## 2. Spec-Driven Development (SDD)

Complex features need planning, not just code.

**8 core phases with optional bootstrap/init:**
```
optional init --> explore --> propose --> spec --+--> tasks --> apply --> verify --> archive
                                            |
                                            +--> design
```

**Adaptive intelligence:**

| Complexity | Signal | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Trivial | One file, < 20 lines | Do it directly, no workflow |
| Small | 1-3 files, one service | Lightweight proposal |
| Medium | Multi-file, one service | SDD from proposal through apply |
| Large | Multi-service, new integration | Full SDD pipeline |
| Critical | Security, auth, payments | Full SDD with mandatory verification |

**What exists today:**
- 8 core SDD phase skills plus optional init/bootstrap/orchestration helpers
- OpenSpec alternative (4 skills for lighter change tracking)
- Engram-backed artifact persistence
- Orchestrator protocol for multi-agent SDD execution

---

## 3. Quality Control

Quality gates enforced by infrastructure, not by hope.

**Constitutional gates (7 example immutable rules):**
1. Mobile never talks directly to microservices (always through the BFF)
2. Mock before integrating (no external vendor without a mock)
3. Tests before merging (all new code must have tests)
4. Secrets never in code (always environment variables)
5. Backward-compatible APIs (no breaking changes without a version bump)
6. Idempotent financial operations (via transaction IDs)
7. Audit trails for all critical operations

**Additional enforcement proof paths:**
- Control manifest: forbidden zones, performance constraints, security constraints
- License policy: automatically blocks AGPL, SSPL, BSL, ELv2 dependencies
- Profile-specific hook projections: minimal currently requires 3 hooks; full maintainer projections are much larger and measured by `scripts/measure_harness_profiles.py`
- Configurable coverage thresholds per industry (80% fintech, 90% healthcare, 50% startup MVP)

**What exists today:**
- Rule packs covering architecture, security, testing, licensing, fault tolerance, and more; default exposure depends on profile
- Hook scripts enforcing rules at runtime when projected for the active profile/harness
- Security hook family: see `hooks/secret-detector.sh`, `hooks/destructive-git-blocker.sh`, and `hooks/destructive-rm-blocker.sh`
- Coverage gate hook with configurable thresholds

---

## 4. Self-Improvement Loop

**Status: DORMANT (propose-only).** The detect/draft loop captures errors and
proposes skill/routing changes. Promotion to runtime mutation is gated by
ADR-201/204/206 and requires human approval. "Autonomous self-improvement" is
**not** claimed for v1.

```
Agents execute tasks
    |
    v
Hooks capture: metrics (tokens, time, cost) + errors (test/lint/build)
    |
    v
Pattern detector injects warnings into upcoming agents
    |
    v
/error-analyzer proposes skill updates
    |
    v
/model-optimizer adjusts model routing
    |
    v
/agent-kpis measures everything with 20 KPIs across 5 OKRs
    |
    v
Improved skills --> more efficient agents --> KPIs improve --> closed loop
```

**Agentic primitives:**
- **Error learning**: Automatic capture of test, lint, and build failures
- **Pattern detection**: 3+ similar errors within 24h trigger warnings
- **Skill adaptation**: After 3+ failures, suggests skill rewrite
- **Automatic skill generation**: Complex solutions are converted into reusable skills
- **Model routing optimization**: Adjusts which model handles which task based on performance
- **Agent KPIs**: 20 metrics across 5 OKRs (quality, efficiency, self-improvement, velocity, security)

---

## 5. Multi-Agent Orchestration

Coordinate multiple AI agents working in parallel without conflicts.

**How it works:**
- Orchestrator pattern: one coordinator delegates work to specialized sub-agents
- Sub-agents receive isolated context with pre-resolved skill references
- Task registration and tracking via active-tasks.json
- Fault tolerance: crashed agents are detected and relaunched
- Idempotent execution: agents verify whether work already exists

**Proven scale:**
- 12+ simultaneous agents
- 100+ total launches in a single session
- Each agent receives accumulated knowledge from Engram

**Fault tolerance (4-tier model):**
1. Connection resilience (reconnection, heartbeat, graceful shutdown)
2. LLM call resilience (auth rotation, rate limit detection, model fallback)
3. Context resilience (pre-compaction flush to Engram, session summary)
4. Agent resilience (orphan detection, parent notification, relaunch)

**Concurrency safety primitives (post-2026-05-07):**
- Worktree-per-write-agent isolation (ADR-220 + ADR-223) with mutex on `git worktree add` to dodge the upstream race
- Stash references by SHA, not position (ADR-221) — eliminates the Anthropic-shipped class of "applied wrong stash" bugs
- Two-phase capture pre-agent stash (ADR-222) — no stash exists if the agent never launched
- Cross-session agent-team file-IPC (ADR-233) — `cos team ...` CLI with TaskCreated/TaskCompleted/TeammateIdle hooks

---

## 6. Replay Timeline & Restore-by-Checkpoint

Devin's signature feature, without the hypervisor.

**Architecture:**
- Off-repo bare git repo per session under `~/.cognitive-os/snapshots/{project_id}/{session_id}/.git`
- Every state-mutating tool call snapshots via `git write-tree`; the SHA rides on the originating event in the per-session JSONL stream
- Three restore modes (Cline-pattern proven UX): files only, conversation only, files+conversation atomic
- Diff preview is mandatory before any restore; `cos rollback` refuses without operator confirmation

**Differentiation:**
- Every governance event (policy check, blast-radius, audit finding) carries a `file_tree_sha`. **Any governance event is itself a restorable checkpoint.** No competitor links policy events to file state with restore capability.
- Captures untracked files at snapshot time — covers the "operator's WIP that wasn't committed" class git stash misses.
- No hypervisor, no cloud service. Pattern proven in production by Cline, Hermes, Kilo.ai, and `git-shadow` — all four use the same primitive.

**Files:**
- `lib/shadow_git.py`, `manifests/shadow-git.yaml`, `cos rollback` CLI

---

## 7. Sync Cost + Retry Gate

The runaway-loop killer. The November 2025 industry $47,000 incident proved that async cost dashboards cannot prevent the next API call. Only synchronous pre-call gates can.

**Sub-features:**
- **Failure classifier (`lib/retry_classifier.py`)** — single authoritative classify_failure() across 7 classes (connection_layer, rate_limit, provider_5xx, validation_error, auth_error, quota_exceeded, unknown). Replaces six contradictory retry magic numbers previously scattered across rule files.
- **Per-failure-class policy (`manifests/retry-contract.yaml`)** — deterministic mapping (max_attempts, backoff, diversity_required, escalation_after_n). Validation errors get re-prompt-with-schema; connection errors get exponential-with-jitter (closes the SDK ECONNRESET silent-drop gap); auth errors don't retry.
- **Per-session budget (`lib/session_budget.py`)** — file-backed ledger at `.cognitive-os/metrics/session-budgets/{session_id}.json`. Pre-call check raises `SessionBudgetExceeded` BEFORE the HTTP request fires.
- **Graduated backpressure** at 70% / 90% / 100% — caution signal injected → cheaper-tier preference → refuse. Avoids the binary hard-stop UX problem.
- **Idempotency keys (`IdempotencyKeyMixin`)** — required on stateful tools. Eliminates the documented 15–30% silent side-effect duplication that retry-without-idempotency ships with industry-wide.
- **Per-provider circuit breaker** — opens on error_rate / p95_latency / quota / validation_failure_rate; cooldown + half-open probe.

**Files:**
- `lib/dispatch_gate.py`, `lib/session_budget.py`, `lib/retry_classifier.py`, `manifests/retry-contract.yaml`, `manifests/session-budget.yaml`

---

## 8. Agent-to-Agent Handoff Protocol

The MAST 2025 paper documented 41–87% production failure rates on state-of-the-art open-source multi-agent systems. The #1 cause: infinite handoff loops (A→B→C→A). **No framework prevents them.** Cognitive OS does.

**Primitives:**
- **`HandoffEnvelope` typed struct (`lib/handoff_envelope.py`)** — every cross-agent call MUST construct one. Carries identity, intent (delegate / handoff / query), context_mode, granted_tools, depth, call_chain.
- **Call-chain deduplication (`lib/handoff_dispatcher.py`)** — before any handoff, dispatcher checks `to_agent in call_chain`. If yes, raise `HandoffCycleDetected` cleanly. Highest-ROI safety primitive in the orchestration space (<1 day of code closes the 41-87% failure class).
- **Permission intersection** — granted tools = caller_grants ∩ receiver_manifest_declares. Compromised sub-agent doesn't get the orchestrator's blast radius.
- **Operator-in-the-loop above blast-radius threshold** — `HandoffRequested` hook can exit code 2 to require operator approval.
- **MAX_HANDOFF_DEPTH = 7** — defense-in-depth against pathological-but-acyclic chains.

**Files:**
- `lib/handoff_envelope.py`, `lib/handoff_dispatcher.py`, `manifests/handoff-protocol.yaml`

---

## 6. Security and Compliance

Enterprise-grade security built into the infrastructure.

**Defense layers:**
- **NeMo Guardrails** (NVIDIA, Apache 2.0): Conversational guardrails — jailbreak detection, topic controls
- **Constitutional gates**: Immutable rules that no agent or prompt can override
- **Production URL blocking**: Hook that prevents accidental interactions with production systems
- **Credential management**: API keys only in environment variables, startup validation, rotation tracking
- **Agent identity system**: Trust levels (0-3), audit trails, monotonic permission attenuation
- **Private mode**: Zero-persistence mode for sensitive conversations
- **License compliance**: Automatic blocking of incompatible dependencies
- **Dangerous command blocking**: Prevents rm -rf, force push, DROP TABLE, docker push to production

**Identity stack (6 layers, designed):**
1. Cryptographic identity (Ed25519 + post-quantum)
2. Credential vault (runtime secret injection)
3. Permissions (YAML-based policy engine)
4. Cross-agent discovery (A2A Agent Cards)
5. Delegation (monotonic attenuation)
6. Infrastructure identity (SPIFFE/SPIRE)

---

## 7. Observability and Cost Control

Know exactly what your AI is doing and how much it costs.

**Observability:**
- **Per-session JSONL streams**: local append-only traces for hook, cost, claim, and runtime events
- **Skill metrics**: Per-skill tracking of tokens, time, cost, and model used
- **Agent KPIs**: 20 metrics across 5 OKRs with configurable alert thresholds

**Cost control:**
- **Synchronous session budget gate**: pre-call budget checks through `lib/session_budget.py` and `lib/dispatch_gate.py`
- **Capability-centric routing**: model/provider selection follows task capability and budget policy
- **Budget alerts**: Configurable warnings and caps

---

## 8. Developer Experience

A rich ecosystem of specialized capabilities exists, but the default user experience is profile-aware. New users should start with minimal/core surfaces; maintainer-scale hooks, rules, and skills are opt-in.

| Primitive | Count | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Skills | 176 `SKILL.md` files in this repo | Includes project, maintainer, package, and experimental skills; not all are default adoption surface |
| Hooks | 244 hook scripts; minimal profile requires 3 | Full Claude projection currently has 153 hook commands; full Codex projection has 64 |
| Rules | 120 rule files | Rule packs are loaded/projected by profile and task context |
| Scripts | 561 script files | Maintainer/developer tooling, not all runtime primitives |
| Agent/persona patterns | Maintainer/team-oriented | Use only when the task needs explicit specialization or coordination |

**Progressive skill loading:**
1. **Always loaded**: compact rules and project instructions only
2. **On demand**: Skills — loaded when invoked by name
3. **Profile-gated**: hooks/rules/skills projected according to minimal, core/team/maintainer, or lab intent

---

## 9. Multi-IDE Portability

Your investment in rules, skills, and memory is not tied to a single tool, but support levels differ by harness. Structural projection is not runtime enforcement.

| Harness | Current proof level | What is claimed |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `native-lifecycle` | Native settings projection for hooks/rules/skills in the supported profile. |
| Codex | `native-lifecycle` with tool-coverage limits | Native lifecycle projection where Codex supports events; governed runner covers known gaps. |
| OpenCode | `governed-wrapper-enforced` starter slice plus structural projection | `opencode.json` structural projection; selected primitives have signed `cos-primitive-guard.js` smoke evidence. |
| Cursor / VS Code Copilot / Gemini CLI / Goose / Aider / Cline / Continue / Kilo / Zed / Qwen / Kimi and similar | `structural` | Project files, instructions, MCP placeholders, or config are generated; runtime enforcement is not claimed. |
| Kiro / Devin / Google Antigravity and other planned hosts | `planned` | Product direction exists; no runtime support claim. |

---

## 10. SRE and Repair Guardrails

Service monitoring and repair guardrails. Treat this as a partially implemented
SRE direction unless a project has wired the relevant health checks, remediation
hooks, and approval policy.

- Health hooks can monitor services in the development stack
- Known fixes stored in Engram
- Safe actions may be automated only when an explicit project policy allows them
- Unsafe actions require human approval
- 4-tier escalation policy

---

## 11. Industry Presets (Plugin System)

Pre-loaded best practices through a plugin architecture.

| Industry | Key Rules | Target Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| Fintech | PCI compliance, audit trails, idempotent operations | 80% |
| Healthcare | HIPAA data handling, consent management, audit logging | 90% |
| E-commerce | Inventory consistency, payment idempotency, PII protection | 70% |
| SaaS | Multi-tenancy isolation, usage metering, SLA compliance | 70% |

---

## 12. Automation Workflows

**Status: DORMANT.** Cognitive OS ships pipeline templates and SDD/OpenSpec procedures, but it does not ship a turnkey ticket-to-production automation path by default.

**5 pipeline types:**
1. Feature pipeline: ticket --> explore --> propose --> spec --> design --> tasks --> apply --> verify
2. Bug fix pipeline: issue --> reproduce --> root-cause --> fix --> test --> verify
3. Migration pipeline: audit --> plan --> extract --> test --> route traffic --> decommission
4. Deploy pipeline: build --> test --> lint --> security scan --> deploy --> smoke test
5. New service pipeline: scaffold --> configure --> implement --> test --> dockerize --> integrate

---

## 13. Source-Available Core

Transparent, extensible, and community-driven under FSL-1.1-MIT before the automatic MIT conversion.

**Repository/product zones:**

| Zone | Current roots | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Core runtime | `hooks/`, `lib/`, `scripts/`, `cmd/cos/`, `pkg/` | Protected runtime and validation surfaces. |
| Compatibility | `internal/`, harness adapters, provider drivers, settings projection | Absorbs vendor and IDE churn. |
| Extensions | `skills/`, `rules/`, `templates/`, `packages/`, `dashboard/`, `workflows/` | Useful capabilities, but not all default adoption surface. |
| Experimental | `squads/`, `agents/`, roadmap/control-plane surfaces | Future architecture until proof paths promote them. |

The machine-readable boundary lives in `manifests/product-zones.yaml` and is checked by `tests/contracts/test_product_zones.py`.

**Quick setup:**
```bash
cd your-project
git clone https://github.com/luum-home/luum-cognitive-os.git .cognitive-os-repo
cp -r .cognitive-os-repo/.cognitive-os/ .cognitive-os/
rm -rf .cognitive-os-repo
claude
> /cognitive-os-init
```
